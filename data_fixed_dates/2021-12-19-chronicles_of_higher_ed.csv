Mission
UNC Asheville is among the nation's best public liberal arts &
sciences colleges and the only designated liberal arts institution
in the North Carolina university system. We are the founders of the
National Conference on Undergraduate Research and our students and
faculty helped to design, fabricate, and install the largest public
art installation ever shown in Times Square, collaborating side by
side with a recent McArthur genius award winner. We offer an
extraordinary liberal arts education at an incredibly affordable
rate (tuition is under $7500 per year for in-state students), all
in the beautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC. 
Our excellence is first and foremost a product of a faculty deeply
committed to both teaching and scholarship in their discipline.
That excellence also demands that our curriculum, co-curricular
activities, and entire community welcome, reflect, and celebrate a
diversity of perspectives, lived experiences, and identities.
Currently, our required core curriculum includes
diversity-intensive courses and we offer living-learning
communities specifically designed for students of
color. 
But we have prioritized doing more. We recently released a Racial
Justice Roadmap that will serve as a guide to the work in which we
will be engaging to become an even more inclusive campus. That
Racial Justice Roadmap includes initiatives that span student
affairs, admissions and financial aid, and critically important,
academic affairs.
In particular, to support the development of a more excellent and
diverse professoriate at UNC Asheville, we are expanding the
University Fellowship for Faculty Diversity (University Fellows)
Program.
The program invites pre-doctoral and post-doctoral candidates
specifically considering careers at a liberal arts institution
which takes equal pride in the excellence of its faculty's teaching
and the quality of its faculty's scholarship and creative
production. UNC Asheville is looking for candidates who are able to
help us advance one of our most important strategic objectives--to
develop, maintain, and support a faculty whose diversity more
closely represents the demographics of the nation and the state of
NC, particularly with respect to race, with special attention to
domestic underrepresentation of minorities in various
disciplines. 
University Fellows Program Details
Faculty at the University of North Carolina Asheville ordinarily
teach 24 credit hours per year. University Fellows will have a
lightened teaching load, receive extensive mentorship, and receive
support for the development of their pedagogy and disciplinary
work. 
In particular, University Fellows should expect to teach as few as
three courses in their first year and will receive funds for
professional development and research and/or creative production
(to be arranged at the time of being awarded the fellowship).
Salaries for pre-doctoral fellows before earning their degree will
be commensurate with lecturers in the discipline; salaries for
fellows who have earned their degree will be commensurate with
visiting assistant professors.
By the early fall of a University Fellow's final year, it will be
determined whether a tenure track offer will be made to the faculty
member. In the event that an offer is not made or the tenure track
position is not one that the fellow would like to accept, we will
support the Fellow in the best ways possible in applying for a
tenure track position elsewhere. 
 A few other details about each fellowship (pre-doctoral vs.
post-doctoral) are summarized below:


Pre-doctoral: 


Three-year term

Course Release:


Teach 12 credit hours over the first year (12 credit hours of
release over the first year, not all to be taken in one
semester).

of year one. There may be opportunities that warrant consideration
of completion beyond the first year, but these will be considered
on a case-by-case basis. 

Salary increase, subject to budget and System Office
constraints, will take place the year subsequent to completion of
the degree.
