The Founding Faculty will have a key role in developing and implementing a program that will serve as an incubator for new approaches and foster a culture of inclusion, creativity, and continuous improvement. While senior and mid-career faculty are particularly encouraged to apply, faculty candidates at all ranks will receive serious consideration.

The Founding Faculty members will be outstanding teacher-scholars with experience in developing and teaching innovative science curricula at the undergraduate level, broad multidisciplinary perspectives, and excellent research programs that can meaningfully involve undergraduates.

The life sciences, computing, and data sciences are central to the new Integrated Sciences program and candidates with backgrounds including (but not limited to) molecular and cell biology, genetics, neuroscience, systems biology, bioinformatics, computational biology, and computational and data science approaches to the natural sciences in general are particularly encouraged to apply.

Claremont McKenna College is a highly selective undergraduate institution of 1300 students ranked among the top liberal arts colleges nationally. It is part of The Claremont Colleges, which also includes Pomona College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College, Claremont Graduate University, and Keck Graduate Institute. Combined, the members of The Claremont Colleges have more than 6000 students. Claremont is located 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

Currently, the shared Keck Science program offers the science general education and major programs for Pitzer, Scripps, and Claremont McKenna Colleges. On its 75th anniversary, CMC is developing its own Integrated Sciences Department to best serve its students and to provide additional resources for the consortium. This is the most ambitious project in the College’s history. The College is making a $400M investment in the Integrated Sciences Program and will hire approximately 25 new faculty members. The Robert Day Sciences Center, designed by the Bjarkes Ingels Group, is slated for completion in AY 2024-25.

The Founding Faculty members will work closely with Ran Libeskind-Hadas (Founding Chair) and Muriel Poston (Vice President for Strategic Initiatives) and be directly involved in (1) planning the department’s academic programs and curricula; (2) developing and teaching transformative new courses including our new integrated science general education courses that will be taken by all CMC students; and (3) recruiting, hiring, and mentoring subsequent cohorts of faculty.

Among the signature elements of the new program are:

• A general education science curriculum that will be taken by all CMC students regardless of their intended major, seeking to develop scientific literacy, particularly in the life sciences, and using computational and data science approaches as vehicles for discovery;
• A set of robust foundations courses for majors that integrate biology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, neuroscience, and computation in creative ways to emphasize the process of scientific discovery and demonstrate important recurring ideas across the sciences;
• New major programs that reflect the department’s themes of health, brain, and planet;
• Collaboration with the College’s social sciences and humanities departments and its unique centers, institutes, and labs to build a program of science in service to society; and
• Rich and ample undergraduate research and project experience.

The successful applicant will have:

• Demonstrated excellence in undergraduate science teaching and mentoring of undergraduate students and a commitment to supporting a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students. Given our institutional value of cultivating an inclusive educational environment, we seek candidates who can demonstrate a commitment to teaching, mentoring, and inspiring students representing a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds, political opinions, genders, races, ethnicities, nationalities, sexual orientations, and religions.
• Experience in the design and implementation of innovative science curricula including those that use creative approaches and pedagogies, span scientific disciplines, and involve computational and data science methods as vehicles for discovery;
• A strong record of scholarship and ability to meaningfully involve undergraduates in research;
• A commitment to working with colleagues across science disciplines as well as those in the social sciences and the humanities to develop science curricula and programs that serve society;
• Disciplinary background in one or more of the areas that support the department’s efforts to build strengths in the life sciences, brain and decision sciences, and climate and environmental sciences are preferred. Strong background in computational and data science methods is desirable and candidates may come from the natural sciences, computing and mathematical sciences, and other allied fields.

The Founding Faculty will have access to outstanding resources at the College and opportunities to engage with faculty from across the Claremont Consortium.
 
Application materials should be submitted at https://webapps.cmc.edu/jobs/faculty/faculty_opening.php and include the following:

• A cover letter that indicates how the applicant’s background and interests align with the vision of the program and the desired attributes outlined above;
• A curriculum vitae;
• A research statement that addresses the applicant’s areas of scholarship, record of external funding, and past experience and future opportunities with engaging undergraduates in research;
• A teaching statement that addresses the applicant’s interests, experiences, and aspirations in undergraduate science education, curriculum development, mentoring of undergraduates, including efforts to support students from diverse backgrounds;
• Evidence of teaching effectiveness (e.g., course evaluations and/or other sources of information);
• The names and email addresses of at least three references who can address the applicant’s experience and effectiveness as an educator and scholar; an email will be automatically sent to them with a link to upload their confidential recommendation letter.

While there are no page limits on any of these materials, the teaching and research statements are intended to be overviews rather than exhaustive lists of activities and two pages are expected to suffice for each of those documents.

Applications are being accepted and will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the positions are filled. The founding faculty are anticipated to join the department in July 2023.

Claremont McKenna College is an equal-opportunity employer. In a continuing effort to enrich its academic environment, the department actively encourages applications from women and members of historically under-represented social groups in higher education.

COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement

As of 12/10/21, the Safer Federal Workforce employee vaccination
requirement is currently suspended pending the outcome of a federal
court-issued injunction. This injunction has suspended the recent
executive order issued by President Biden requiring all employees
of federal contractors to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. For
current status of the vaccine requirement and/or questions, please
visit FAQs for Employee Vaccination
Requirement.

Background Information

Northern Arizona University requires satisfactory results for the
following: a criminal background investigation, an employment
history verification and a degree verification (in some cases)
prior to employment. You may also be required to complete a
fingerprint background check.

Additionally, as an employer in the state of Arizona, NAU is
required to participate in the federal E-Verify program that
assists employers with verifying new employees' right to work in
the United States.

Finally, each year Northern Arizona University releases an 
Annual Security Report. The report is a result of a federal law
known as the Clery Act. The report includes Clery reportable crime
statistics for the three most recent completed calendar years and
discloses procedures, practices and programs NAU uses to keep
students and employees safe including how to report crimes or other
emergencies occurring on campus. In addition, the 
Fire Safety Report is combined with the Annual Security Report
for the NAU Flagstaff Mountain Campus as this campus has on-campus
student housing. This report discloses fire safety policies and
procedures related to on-campus student housing and statistics for
fires that occurred in those facilities.

If you would like a free paper copy of the report, please contact

For many years, the English Department has been at the center of the college’s commitments to the liberal arts and interdisciplinary research and education. The English Department offers three majors: an English major, a modified version of the English major for students who are pursuing a teaching license (at the middle and high school level), and a recently introduced major in creative writing. Each year, 40-60 St. Olaf students graduate with one of our majors, making us one of the most popular departments on campus by that measure. Our recently revised major requirements balance our commitment to offering students flexibility in choosing an individual path through the major with our commitments to antiracism (in part via a new antiracism requirement—a requirement that students take at least one course that centers on antiracist pedagogy and that includes an examination of the ways in which literature and literary history has been shaped by institutional racism within the field) and to fostering a global perspective on contemporary literature and literary history.

also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and

professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through
consultative services, continuing education, and the extended

We seek candidates for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position beginning Fall 2023 in the Clinical Psychology area of the Department of Psychology in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences with a research program focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEI and J) in mental health, broadly defined. For example, we seek applicants who address systemic inequities that impact mental health or present barriers to treatment, applicants whose research examines disparities in access to or efficacy of evidence-based treatments, applicants whose work centers on developing, evaluating, disseminating, and/or implementing culturally responsive assessment and treatment approaches with traditionally underserved populations, and/or applicants whose work centers on the inclusion and enhanced understanding of diverse identities. We anticipate that a wide range of research programs beyond these specific examples would match the position, and we encourage applications on all DEI and J relevant mental health research.  We see possibilities for a scholar to connect with our current research at many methodological levels, for example, basic science, prevention, screening and assessment, intervention, and/or implementation. Our department values a developmental approach with many of our faculty having interests in human development, especially during the prenatal period, infancy & early childhood, childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood, and many sharing an interest in understanding stress, early experiences, and development. A developmental focus is not required for this position, but candidates should articulate those interests if they are part of their current or future research plans. Candidates should describe how their research connects to and complements the existing research strengths of our clinical faculty and other departmental faculty.
Successful applicants will have an outstanding record of research achievement and a strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate education, including classroom teaching, mentoring, and clinical supervision in evidence-based approaches.

Candidates should be licensed or license-eligible in Colorado.
The Department of Psychology is research-oriented, valuing a collaborative and integrative approach to psychological science that fosters intellectual curiosity and innovation and invests in people in a supportive and inclusive environment. Our mission is to advance psychological science by generating and sharing new knowledge through collaborative scholarship, educating and mentoring student scholars, and contributing to the public good. Our Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program is APA-accredited and ascribes to a clinical science model, including membership in the Academy of Psychological Clinical Science.  We are a broad clinical program with a specialty emphasis in children, adolescents, and families.  Over the last decade, the department has taken intentional steps towards enacting our inclusive vision of success, including increasingly diversifying the perspectives and identities of our faculty and graduate students, establishing leadership roles focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, and engaging in professional development activities focused on building knowledge, skills and awareness of diverse lived experiences and systemic inequities that can create barriers to thriving.
The University of Denver endeavors to be a great university dedicated to the public good and to uphold the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. The University recognizes that its success is dependent on how well it lives these values, including how we engage, support, and champion members both at DU and in the greater community.

We invite applications from emerging scholars who are exploring global aspects of the medieval period emerging from but not restricted to English literature and culture. Global study of the Middle Ages encompasses networks of trade, patterns of migration or conflict, the transmission of scientific knowledge, and histories of cultural translation, appropriation, and exclusion. We therefore anticipate applications from scholars whose work attends to the history of a text’s travels, translations, and material forms as well as to textual representations of the world and its inhabitants. We also welcome consideration of how such research intersects with theories and practices related to race, ethnicity, religion, class, ability and disability, animal studies, theories of materiality, and environmental studies.

In addition to undergraduate and graduate courses related to their area of specialization, the successful candidate will also teach courses on literary history and literary analysis for the undergraduate major in English or in the College of Arts and Science Core Curriculum. They will also have opportunities to teach for the Ph.D Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies for NYU’s Medieval and Renaissance Center (MARC), as well as opportunities to design graduate courses as part of the Advanced Certificate in Public Humanities program. We are interested in considering scholars who demonstrate a commitment to public humanities and public-facing scholarship.

The position is open at the rank of a tenure-track Assistant Professor or early-stage Associate Professor with tenure. The IE faculty cluster is part of UCI’s Black Thriving Initiative (BTI) and seeks to attract a cadre of engaged scholars across the fields of planning, policy, engineering, environmental science, and law to address social, environmental, and racial disparities in infrastructure planning, design, and implementation. Participating units include CEE in the Samueli School of Engineering; the Department of Urban Planning and Public Policy in the School of Social Ecology; the Department of Earth System Science in the School of Physical Science; and the School of Law. The Cluster’s curriculum and programming components will foster cross-campus collaborations, build a community of scholars trained in community-based research, and engage with community organizations and governmental agencies in Black and other historically marginalized communities to advance equity in infrastructure and climate investments and policy. For more information, consult the IE cluster website: https://sites.uci.edu/iecluster/.
Applicants for this CEE faculty position are sought with expertise and aspirations to integrate equity considerations into engineering processes, analyses, models, and data collection that shape the design, construction, operations and/or maintenance of civil infrastructure. The Department is open to candidates whose interests are focused on one or more types of civil infrastructure, such as transportation systems or flood management systems, as well as the externalities of infrastructure such as air pollution and other environmental impacts, public health, social disruption of communities, access to opportunity, declines in safety, and vulnerability to natural hazards, climate change, and other threats. The Department is especially interested in candidates with a strong engineering background, and a vision for innovating the nation’s aging civil infrastructure (including its design, operation, and maintenance) to improve livelihoods, deliver greater equity, more easily adapt to climate and human-driven change, and achieve higher levels of sustainability. Successful candidates are expected to bring research experience with Black and/or other historically marginalized communities. The Department will favor Assistant Professor candidates with deep core research strengths over candidates with broad expertise and less depth. At the Associate Professor level, the department seeks candidates with an expanding core of nationally recognized research strengths. The Department also seeks a candidate who would complement existing faculty expertise and interests and support the delivery of CEE undergraduate and graduate programs.
Launched in 2020 during the racial reckoning, the UCI Black Thriving Initiative mobilizes the entire university to transform UCI into the nation's foremost destination for Black people to thrive as students, faculty, staff, and communities served by the university. To this end, it consists of three action platforms that seek to inform choices, decisions, and priorities as a great public research university. These are: change the culture, leverage the mission, and engage with communities. A major feature of BTI involves advancing understanding about the multifaceted Black experience and drivers of well-being in support of Black communities. The associated faculty cluster hiring program builds on and expands our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion, and commitment to social justice. Selected from a multi-year competition, the three BTI hiring clusters reflect the power and promise of interdisciplinary collaboration. They are: Environmental Health Disparities, Infrastructure Equity, and Poetic Justice. To accelerate and elevate the impact of the research, teaching, and service of participating and affiliated faculty, each cluster will receive dedicated programming support for three years. For more information, consult the BTI website: https://inclusion.uci.edu/action-plan/msi/uci-black-thriving-initiative/.
Priority will be given to applications received by October 15, 2022; however, applications will be accepted until the position is filled. Candidates must have completed a Ph.D. degree in civil and environmental engineering or a related field by the position start date, July 1, 2023 (teaching duties will begin Fall 2023). CEE recognizes the value of diversity in its faculty and strongly supports UCI’s mission for equity and inclusiveness. We are committed to ensuring accountability, providing training and education, conducting responsive research, and building sustainable partnerships. All qualified applicants are encouraged to apply. Please direct questions about this position to the chair of the search committee, Professor Brett F. Sanders, at bsanders@uci.edu.

The institutional reference checks involve contacting the administration of the applicant’s previous institution(s) to ask whether there have been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the University’s Faculty Code of Conduct.

About the University
The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the
traditional homelands of the Kalapuya people. Following treaties

removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon. Today, Kalapuya
descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated Tribes of
Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and they
continue to make important contributions to their communities, to
the University of Oregon, to the land we now call Oregon, and to
the world.

About the University
The University of Oregon has a long tradition of environmental
research and activism and is nationally known for our
interdisciplinary study of the environment. Environmental justice
in the U.S. has been a core concern of scholarship in environmental
studies, and this hire promises to add to the UO's expertise and to
expand our departmental focus. UO is also one of a shrinking number
of universities committed to teaching about racial, gender and
LGBTQ justice. Our university requires students to take courses
that focus on power and inequality. Our Provost has dedicated
university resources to advancing programs that support faculty who
teach these courses through awards, fellowships and mentorship. We
are especially interested in candidates, therefore, who can support
this work in mentoring, research, teaching, and outreach with
women, first-generation students, communities of color, and other
underrepresented groups. We encourage applications from all
qualified candidates, and strongly encourage women, faculty of
color, LGBTQIA faculty and faculty with disabilities to apply. All
applicants are requested to include in their cover letter
information about how they will contribute to this work.

The University of Oregon is one of only two Pacific Northwest
members of the Association of American Universities and holds the
distinction of a “very high research activity” ranking in the
Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. UO
enrolls more than 20,000 undergraduate and 3,600 graduate students
representing all 50 states and nearly 100 countries. In recent
years, the university has increased the diversity of its student
body, as well as campus-wide efforts to build a welcoming,
inclusive community. UO's beautiful, 295-acre campus features
state-of-the art facilities in an arboretum-like setting. We are
located in Eugene, a vibrant city of 157,000 with a wide range of
cultural and culinary offerings, a pleasant climate, and a
community engaged in environmental and social concerns. The campus
is within easy driving distance of the Pacific Coast, the Cascade
Mountains, and Portland.

non-traditional students and students from underrepresented ethnic

POSITION DESCRIPTION
The Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine invites applications for a tenure-track or tenured Assistant/Associate Professor position in Black Studies. Geographic area and thematic research foci are open. We especially welcome applications from scholars whose research provides critical perspectives on racism, white supremacy, and racial capitalism by deploying intersectional Black theories and methodologies, such as, but not limited to, Black ecologies, Black queer and feminist theory, Black radicalism, embodiment, Black geographies, abolition, decolonization, Black liberation, African diaspora, and global Blackness.
The position is made possible by the UCI Black Thriving Initiative (BTI) Faculty Cluster Hiring Program, an effort to recruit cohorts of faculty across the campus who interrogate anti-blackness as an existential threat to the health and welfare of communities worldwide. The successful candidate will be expected to participate in BTI-sponsored collaborative multidisciplinary programs with their cohort of fellow hires as part of the Environmental Health Disparities cluster. This cluster will advance public and community engagement regarding environmental racism and health stressors that have historically and actively worked against Black well-being (see: https://sites.uci.edu/cehdr/jobs/).
We seek applicants whose research and teaching focus on areas that include, but are not limited to:
• Health ecologies (for instance: medical racism, reproductive justice, health disparities, genomics, environmental stress, or health systems)
• Ecologies and environments (for instance: environmental justice, climate impacts, toxicities, degradation, built environments, urbanisms, outer space, and multispecies studies)
• Indigenous studies (for instance: lifeworlds, land, heritage studies, dispossession, governance, and settler colonialism)
• Geographies and economies (for instance: food geographies, plantation economies, racialized space, diasporic politics, migration, labor, material culture).
This position will be housed 100% in the Department of Anthropology, which has a reputation for experimental, collaborative, and interdisciplinary methods, theoretical innovation, and social justice commitments.
A Ph.D. in anthropology or a cognate field is required at the time of appointment.
The position start date is July 1, 2023. In addition to a strong research agenda, applicants must demonstrate a commitment to teaching and mentoring a diverse body of graduate and undergraduate students.
The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application, and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in a safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment, discrimination, exploitation, or intimidation. With this commitment as well as a commitment to addressing all forms of academic misconduct, UC Irvine conducts institutional reference checks for candidates finalists to whom the department or other hiring unit would like to extend a formal offer of appointment into Ladder Rank Professor or Professor of Teaching series, at all ranks (i.e., assistant, associate, and full). The institutional reference checks involve contacting the administration of the applicant’s previous institution(s) to ask whether there have been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the University’s Faculty Code of Conduct. To implement this process, UC Irvine requires all candidates of Ladder Rank Professor or Professor of Teaching series, at all ranks (i.e., assistant, associate, and full) to complete, sign, and upload the form entitled “Authorization to Release Information” into AP RECRUIT as part of their application. If the candidate does not include the signed authorization to release information with the application materials, the application will be considered incomplete. As with any incomplete application, the application will not receive further consideration. Although all applicants for faculty recruitments must complete the entire application, only finalists (i.e., those to whom the department or other hiring unit would like to extend a formal offer) considered for Ladder Rank Professor or Professor of Teaching series, at all ranks (i.e., assistant, associate, and full) positions will be subject to institutional reference checks.
UCI is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer advancing inclusive excellence. Applications from all qualified candidates, including women, underrepresented minorities, LGBTQ and gender non-binary persons, are welcome. In addition to competitive salary and attractive benefits packages, including a housing assistance program, the university also offers robust equity and inclusion programs, such as family-friendly policies and support for dual career couples.

Assistant or Associate Professor, Anthropology
Anthropology

Location: Waco, Texas
Open Date: Jun 10, 2022
Deadline: Sep 30, 2022 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time

Description:
The Department of Anthropology within the College of Arts &
Sciences at Baylor University is accepting applications for an
assistant (tenure-track) OR associate (tenured or tenure-track)
professor. This position is open to applicants with research and
teaching interests in human health (broadly conceived). Preferred
research areas include but are certainly not limited to global
health, evolutionary medicine, human biology, health
disparities/inequalities, medical anthropology, psychological
anthropology/mental health, biomedical anthropology, biocultural
anthropology, molecular anthropology, public health, environmental
health, health of indigenous and pre-historic populations.
Applicants whose research have transdisciplinary foci and applied
relevance are preferred.

The new faculty member will join a growing department with interest
in applied perspectives on the anthropology of health, broadly
conceived. Interest in contributing to the new, unique PhD program
(in the Anthropology of Health) is required, and skills appropriate
for training graduates for applied work are preferred. Faculty
members are required to contribute to teaching, research, and
service. Expectations for an active research agenda include
publishing and granting, as well as involving students as
appropriate. Start-up packages are available, and the standard
teaching load is two courses per semester (although this depends on
research activity). The Graduate School also generously supports
research assistantships for new or transferring doctoral students
associated with this position. Those applying for the associate
level should demonstrate appropriate advanced experience.

Located in Waco, Texas, Baylor University is the oldest
college in Texas. With a population of 21,000 students, Baylor is
one of the top universities in the nation, having just been named
an R1 institution by the Carnegie Classification in 2022. Baylor is
also on the honor roll of the ""Great Colleges to Work For"" from
The Chronicle of Higher Education; Baylor offers
competitive salaries and benefits while giving faculty and staff the chance to
live in one of the fastest-growing parts of the state. Our
strategic plan, Illuminate, guides the University as we
continue to live up to Baylor's mission of educating men and women for
worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic excellence
and Christian commitment within a caring community.


Qualifications:
Our current faculty members all contribute somehow to the
health initiative (including Environmental
Determinants, Biomedical Research, Family and Community
Determinants, Health Policy, and Medical Education)
of Baylor’s strategic plan “Illuminate” (https://illuminate.web.baylor.edu/)
in addition to the initiatives in Human Flourishing and
Latin America. We aim to continue this trend.

Given the general topic of the anthropology of health, we
anticipate recruiting someone capable of teaching courses that
would be cross-listed in other departments like Biology,
Environmental Science, Medical Humanities, and Psychology and
Neuroscience, among others. Successful applicants would likely have
secondary appointments in other departments (Anthropology is
considered a STEM discipline at Baylor).

The Department of Anthropology values diversity and is especially
interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and
excellence of our academic community through research, teaching,
and service. We also accept the American Association of Biological
Anthropologists' Code of Ethics, the American Anthropological
Association’s Statement on Ethics, the Society for Applied
Anthropology’s Statement of Ethics and Professional
Responsibilities, and the American Association of University
Professors' Sexual Harassment Policy. We pledge to respect each
other, our students, and the people, animals, and places we
study.


Application Instructions:
To apply, visit https://apply.interfolio.com/106383

Applications will be reviewed on a continual basis. To ensure full
consideration, complete applications should be submitted by
9/30/2022. The following materials should be uploaded into
Interfolio: cover letter (explaining qualifications, current and
future research plans, and teaching experience and philosophy),
current curriculum vitae, transcript of highest degree earned (or
if PhD is in progress, a copy of transcript showing completed PhD
hours; unofficial transcripts are acceptable for now), and the
contact information (names, email addresses, and phone numbers) for
three potential references (referees will be contacted by the
search committee separately). Finalists for the position will be
required to submit official doctoral transcripts in advance of a
campus visit. Employment will be contingent upon the successful
completion of a background check. The candidate should possess an
earned doctorate (at the time of appointment) in an appropriate
field of study; doctoral candidates capable of finishing their PhD
before August 15 will also be considered in this search.

The Department of Criminal Justice Studies was first formed in the early 2000s and dedicated to exploring the conception and implementation of law, crime and justice systems and ideas. The department emphasizes critical thinking about law, crime and justice systems and their entanglement with larger political economic processes.  In particular, the program trains students to explore how ideas and systems of crime, law and justice shape broader issues of social justice, especially those related to the experience of race, class, gender, sexuality, and age inequity in the U.S. Our program fosters critical thinking, analytical capacity, and information literacy such that students can challenge structures and assumption and innovatively contribute to the assessment of alternative solutions to problems associated with the identification, control, and prevention of crime and delinquency. We are a dynamic department of 8 tenure-track faculty, and 14 additional lecturer faculty, with close to 1,000 students, that values community engagement, mutual support, and transformative approaches to safety and security. Our current repertoire of tenure-track faculty members embrace and reflect through their accomplishments a strong commitment to equity, social justice, and fostering critical thinking about crime, law and justice systems.

academic research and writing;
interdisciplinary analysis of the production of systemic inequality through crime, legal, and justice systems; and/or
engagement with analyses and strategies to end structural oppression based on class, race, gender, sexuality and/or disability.

We are particularly interested in scholars studying how the observed racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system might be reduced through legal reform, structural and organizational change, innovative community initiatives, and more inclusive and equitable public policy. We seek candidates whose research is well grounded in relevant theoretical perspectives of the study of race and ethnicity, criminal justice, and public administration and policy. We welcome applicants who employ a variety of methodological approaches including but not limited to the analysis of large-N data, ethnography, experiments, and interpretive and critical research methods.
This position is part of the university’s Race, Inclusion, and Social Equity (RAISE) Initiative to enhance our world-class research program on race, inclusion, and social equity through recruitment of faculty whose research can help narrow social disparities in educational attainment, health outcomes, rates of incarceration, political representation, environmental injustice, and economic well-being. This position will be part of a cluster hire of four faculty members focused on advancing racial and criminal justice through collaborative science. The positions will be in the following units: Political Science, Sociology, Moritz College of Law, and John Glenn College of Public Affairs. The cluster hire is supported by the university’s Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, Institute for Democratic Engagement and Accountability, Translational Data Analytics Institute, Drug Enforcement and Policy Center, and the Criminal Justice Research Center.

Responsibilities of the position include maintaining a robust research program, pursuing external funding, contributing to excellence in graduate and undergraduate teaching and mentoring, and providing service to the university and the profession. Scholars who can work collaboratively within a multidisciplinary team are of particular interest, as are those who can engage with other programs and interdisciplinary research centers at the university.

Additional Information
The position will begin in the fall of 2023. Salary will be commensurate with the candidate’s experience and qualifications. Applicants must have completed all doctoral degree requirements by the time of their appointment. Successful candidates will likely have doctorates in relevant fields such as public administration, public policy, criminal justice, sociology, or political science, and a demonstrated commitment toward social equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Questions regarding the position may be sent to the search committee chair, Russell Hassan, at Hassan.125@osu.edu.            

Application Instructions
The review of applications will begin on October 1. Applications will be evaluated as they are received and will be accepted until the position is filled. To apply, please submit a letter of application that addresses your ability to contribute toward Glenn College’s research, teaching, and diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, a curriculum vitae, a sample research manuscript, and three professional letters of reference through Ohio State University’s job application portal.

identifying that power and privilege can be a resource. Identifying

recognizes that your individual exposure to diversity is a function
of your background. We value those from relatively homogenous
cultural contexts as well as those from diverse cultural contexts,
whether in the U.S. or internationally, where diversity may take on

Department Summary
The Robert D. Clark Honors College (CHC) is a liberal arts honors
college within the University of Oregon. Founded in 1960, it is one
of the oldest public university honors colleges in the United
States. The College features a newly restructured curriculum that

The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the

of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and
forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon. Today,
Kalapuya descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated
Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz
Indians, and they continue to make important contributions to their
communities, to the UO, to Oregon, and to the world.

Position Description


The Psychology Department [https://psychology.ucsc.edu/] at the University
of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for a
tenure-track assistant professor position in social psychology. We
seek to hire a scholar who views social issues through a structural
lens and whose research advances the unique social justice focus of
our program. We are particularly interested in scholars who can
contribute to our intellectual emphasis on diversity, social
policy, and social change and who utilize intersectional
approaches. Possible areas of specialization include (but are not
limited to) race, ethnicity, and inequality; oppression and
privilege; prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination; sexual and
gender diversity; social and economic justice movements (including
grassroots or collective action); educational access, equity, and
fairness; social psychological analyses of neoliberal policies and
practices (e.g., gentrification); migration, immigration, and
citizenship; colonialism and decolonization; the social psychology
of health and health disparities; political psychology;
environmental justice; and policy analysis or assessment (in any
content area). We are especially interested in candidates with
expertise and interests in psychology and law, including the social
psychology of justice-oriented and criminal justice policies,
practices, and institutions. Candidates should be actively engaged
in research and show promise of continued research productivity. In
addition, they should be prepared to teach both graduate and
undergraduate level courses in social psychology and to contribute
significantly to graduate education through mentoring of graduate
students. We seek to hire scholars whose strengths best complement
the distinctive character of our social justice oriented social
psychology program and are especially interested in candidates who
can contribute to the diversity and excellence of our academic
community through their research, teaching, and service. The
successful candidate must be able to work with students, faculty
and staff from a wide range of social and cultural backgrounds. UC
Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving and an Asian American and Native
American Pacific Islander Serving Institution with a high
proportion of first-in-family undergraduate students.

We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing women and
minorities who are underrepresented in higher education careers (as
evidenced by life experiences and educational background), and who
have experience in equity and diversity with respect to teaching,
mentoring, research, life experiences, or service towards building
an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

The Political Economy Program at the University of California,
Berkeley seeks a tenure-track assistant professor for a position

Economics, History, Sociology, Anthropology, Political Science, or
Business.

Berkeley Political Economy has been a leading program in
interdisciplinary political economy for undergraduates for more
than 40 years and has recently launched a graduate program, the
Designated Emphasis in Political Economy. This search represents an
important step in an ambitious plan to expand and strengthen
political economy at Berkeley: adding faculty, developing courses,
building the graduate program, and expanding the Network for a New
Political Economy (a campus network of faculty and students
interested in political economy) into a leading research
center.

We seek scholars from a related discipline who would be
enthusiastic about joining such an enterprise and participating in
the reconceptualization of this program. We encourage applications
from scholars whose long-term research agenda seeks to bridge
multiple fields. We would especially be interested in scholars who
could offer required courses in Economics (such as introduction to
economics or intermediate macroeconomics or microeconomics) and/or
History (such as a global history survey or more focused historical
context courses), or upper division courses in priority areas for
curriculum expansion such as finance, public health, climate
change, the digital economy, race, ethnicity, and/or immigration
and migration.

We encourage applications from current or recent PhD candidates and
graduates; current and recent postdocs; current assistant
professors (including those who are “senior” assistant professors
near tenure).

The Political Economy program recognizes the intrinsic relationship
between diversity and excellence in all our endeavors. We embrace
open and equitable access to opportunities for learning and
development as our obligation and goal. We seek candidates who
demonstrate a commitment to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion,
and belonging through their research, teaching, and/or service. UC
Berkeley is committed to upholding the university's principles of
community so that every individual can be successful in a healthy,
welcoming, and safe environment. Additional information about

pandemic, particularly for disadvantaged groups, in our evaluation
of applicants, dips in productivity in otherwise strong records
occurring with the onset of the pandemic will be evaluated with the
context of the pandemic in mind.

For sciences faculty, a standard teaching load is 2/1/2, two courses with labs per semester, or 3/1/3, three courses without labs. Faculty teach one course during our January term, or Interim, which provides opportunities for faculty and students to apply more experiential learning of non-traditional topics, including international travel to unique and biodiverse destinations. 
We seek candidates eager to pursue diverse types of scholarship in their discipline or in collaboration with researchers in other areas. A fundamental ethos of our department is to foster undergraduate engagement in our scholarship. Applicants should write a 1- to 3-page statement articulating their scholarly aspirations and how they align with this ethos, which often requires adaptation to the practicalities of a small undergraduate institution (see #6 below under Application).

Preference will be given to applicants who demonstrate interest in service to the biology department and Wofford College as a whole, embrace the collaborative spirit of our institution, and/or show an interest in public engagement. 
Because Wofford College is committed to building and supporting a diverse educational environment, we invite applicants to include a 1-page statement that articulates how their experiences or future efforts would contribute to both the department and campus fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment (see #7 below under Application). 
 
APPLICATION: Application material should be submitted electronically to biologysearch@wofford.edu, as a single PDF. Application material should include: (1) a cover letter explaining your interest and suitability for this position, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) unofficial graduate transcripts, (4) names and contact information of four references, (5) a statement of your teaching philosophy, which should articulate a commitment to the educational ethos outlined above, (6) a statement of your future research and scholarly aspirations that align with our ethos and support your goals of becoming a teacher-scholar at a small undergraduate institution, and (7) a statement that demonstrates a genuine interest in working with departmental and campus efforts to develop a diverse and inclusive campus environment. 
Completed applications received by Oct. 10 will be given full consideration. Letters will be requested for applicants advancing beyond the first round of screening.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
The University of California, Santa Barbara, is one of ten campuses that comprise the University of California system and is a member of the Association of American Universities. The University Library at UC Santa Barbara is a member of the Association of Research Libraries.
Individually and collectively, the University of California (UC) Libraries provide access to the world’s knowledge for the UC campuses and the communities they serve, supporting UC’s missions of teaching, research, and public service. The University of California has a deep commitment to its leadership role in the transformation of scholarly communications toward greater openness in the dissemination of scholarship. A major initiative is working to collaboratively transform scholarly publishing and communication, as described in the 2018 Pathways to Open Access strategic roadmap. In partnership with the UC Academic Senate, the libraries are utilizing system-wide journal contract renewals to negotiate and implement transformative open access agreements with scholarly journal publishers. UC’s transformative agreements at present cover up to 30 % of UC publications, with a goal of rapid progress through additional agreements.
The UC open access (OA) policies reserve rights for UC faculty and other employees to make their articles freely available to the public in an open access repository. eScholarship offers a robust scholarly publishing platform that enables departments, research units, publishing programs, and individual scholars associated with the University of California to have direct control over the creation and dissemination of the full range of their scholarship. With a very dynamic and innovative UC Libraries community of scholarly communication librarians, UC is actively leading the broader conversation in North America around transforming the current publishing model toward open scholarship.

The Collection Strategist will work collaboratively and closely with other Library departments, and with campus faculty and students in a highly interdisciplinary research community renowned for its academic excellence and global impact.
The University of California Libraries are recognized nationally and internationally as a leader in advancing Open Access and are well on the way to integrating its open values into collection strategies. As part of the Collection Strategies Department, the incumbent will have the opportunity to contribute to the reshaping of the Library’s strategic approach to open scholarship and to cultivate a culture of assessment for a broader concept of library content that responds to developments in the rapidly evolving Open Access landscape.
The Library is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of the academic community through research, teaching, and service. This position is eligible for a flexible work arrangement including a combination of onsite and remote work.

The Portland-based institute is made possible by a gift of more than $425 million from Connie and Steve Ballmer, co-founders of Ballmer Group Philanthropy.
The Ballmer Institute establishes a new national model for children’s behavioral and mental health care by uniting the UO’s top-ranked research programs, Oregon public schools, families, and community support groups in the creation and delivery of promotion, prevention, and intervention programs that can be part of the daily lives of children and adolescents. The Institute will serve K-12 students, while prioritizing the needs of children, adolescents, and families who have been persistently and/or historically underserved. The Institute will offer a new undergraduate degree program and a new graduate certificate program for educators, to train a new workforce that is well-equipped to meet children’s needs within schools and organizations. Tenure line faculty will work collaboratively with a staff of trained clinical faculty to provide support to students.
The Ballmer Institute is seeking to hire up to ten (10) open rank tenure-related faculty members in the area of child and adolescent behavioral health. Four new faculty hires are anticipated for Fall 2023 with search efforts continuing until all positions are filled. Candidates for these positions should have a program of research in child behavioral health which could include areas such as prevention science, intervention science, and/or health promotion with expertise in addressing the needs of historically and/or persistently underserved communities.
