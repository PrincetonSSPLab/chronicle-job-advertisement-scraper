contemporary challenges. An emphasis on the connections between all

environment is apparent in the scholarly research and built work of
many of our faculty. Following a decade-long transformation of the
school’s faculty and professional programs, and a major increase in
its endowment, the Faculty has recently expanded its undergraduate
and graduate programs. Most recently, Forestry has been welcomed as
a new program which will broaden the research and teaching reach of

equity and intersectional understanding of systems of oppression
that are currently in play in early learning and care (ELC). The
ECS program embeds concepts of multilingualism and anti-racism
throughout all their required core courses.  While at Cal Poly
Pomona, Early Childhood Studies’ students learn processes important
for early childhood development and identify implications of theory
in the examination and application of principles and practices
within diverse family, program, and community contexts. Program
graduates are prepared to work in infant-toddler programs,
preschools, elementary schools, careers in home visiting, family
support programs, post-baccalaureate degree programs, and other
professional contexts that focus on working with young children and
families. For students to obtain the knowledge, skills, and
dispositions to work with children and families during the most
critical developmental time in a child’s life we provide hands-on
experiences through service learning, internships, practicum, and
fieldwork. ECS students have the opportunity to interact with
children and families in our campus childcare center as well as our
family-friendly space at the CPP library that supports parenting
students and their children. To support our diverse student
population, courses are offered in diverse modalities including
face-to-face, hybrid, and online. In Spring 2021, the ECS
Department was awarded NAEYC Accreditation, becoming the first
university in the State of California to earn this
distinction.  
We have a highly collaborative department. We regularly update
our curriculum, support our diverse students, collaborate with
community partnerships, and advocate for children and families in
organizations such as PEACH (Partnerships in Education,
Articulation, and Collaboration in Higher Education).  Our
faculty are also highly engaged in supporting families on campus
and developed CPP
KARES (Cal Poly Pomona Kids Activities and Resources for
Educational Support) and Family Friendly Space at the CPP library.
We are currently involved in a state-wide project, which aims to
identify foundational competencies for early childhood
professionals to have in working with multilingual children and
families, and to develop a formative assessment tool through our
collaboration with other stakeholders in the region.
 
The new faculty member will be a part of the Ethnic Studies
Affinity Faculty and will have the opportunity to engage with a new
and permanent Office of Ethnic Studies Affinity Teaching and
Scholarship.  This is a space for collaboration across
disciplines and methodological vantage points, mentorship, and
professional development programming.  The Ethnic Studies
Affinity Faculty, and the resources to support them, are a key
element of CPP’s ongoing efforts to ensure the flourishing of our
diverse students and faculty and be the leading inclusive
polytechnic university in the nation.

requirements; assessment; and lifecycle management of data
resources that support UCSB scholarship and teaching. Recognizing
the unique strength of interdisciplinary scholarship on the UC

scholarly collections and provide access to resources that cross
traditional disciplinary boundaries and support new fields of
inquiry.

educational research program, supported by external grants, focused
on the senior design program or other experiential learning
programs.

We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing
traditionally underrepresented groups in higher education, and who
have engaged in teaching, research, professional and/or public
service contributions that promote diversity, equity, and
inclusion. These can take a variety of forms such as, but not
limited to, effective pedagogical strategies used for the
educational advancement of students in underrepresented groups;
demonstrated contributions to the advancement of access and equal
opportunity in education; and participation in activities that
support the recruitment, retention, and success of scholars and
students.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement

DESCRIPTION: Humboldt State University's Department of Sociology

position in Cannabis Studies (CS). Launching in August 2023, this
interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts will be the first of its kind in
the nation. The successful candidate has the potential to serve as
Program Leader guiding the implementation of this exciting new
major.

Disciplinary and subarea expertise are open. The BA in Cannabis
Studies includes a rigorous core of history, theory, and

vary based on the concentration. Successful candidates must
demonstrate training and expertise in cannabis policy and history,
an active related research agenda, commitment to inclusive teaching
excellence, and evidence of the ability to support diverse student
communities on a variety of professional pathways.
While the major is interdisciplinary, the core curriculum
emphasizes cannabis intersections with place, sustainability, and
social justice. Students explore the historical, cultural, social,
political, and legal contexts of cannabis through social and
environmental justice frameworks. Program concentrations include
Equity and Social Justice, and Environmental Stewardship, with
elective offerings from many fields: Anthropology; Botany;
Communication; Criminology & Justice Studies; Critical Race;
Economics; Environmental Science & Management; Environmental
Studies; Film; Forestry & Wildland Resources; Gender &

strategic planning, and development of dynamic, student-centered
teaching practices. The ideal candidate will share the program,
department, and campus commitment to the inclusive education of a
racially and socioeconomically diverse student community, and
supporting their degree and career success. We will prioritize
applicants who demonstrate a nuanced understanding of diversity and
equity in higher education. The successful candidate will also be

of disciplinary fields, and expertise in theoretical frameworks
related to social justice, equity, and environmental stewardship.
An ABD will be considered if degree requirements are completed by

Pathology introduces students to the cellular system of each organ
and traces the morphological changes in a cell that are responsible
for a disease in an organ.  As cells undergo alteration, their
change in function is studied in respect to its deviation from the
""normal"" state.
 
Course presentation includes the response of cells, tissues and
organs to disease and injury; the normal and adapted cell;
degeneration and necrosis, inflammation, fluid and hemodynamic
derangements; neoplasia; immune-pathology; systemic, environmental
and nutritional disease. Lecture discussions are supplemented by a
study of gross and microscopic specimens
 
 
PATHOLOGY II (12 CREDITS)
Pathology II applies the basic concepts learned in Pathology I
to continue the study of pathologic basis of disease using a
physiologic system, or organ-based approach. This course covers red
and white cell diseases, male and female genital tracts, and kidney
and liver systems.
 
Course presentations include etiology, pathogenesis and
morphologic changes in diseases according to organ system.
Appropriate use of the laboratory is stressed in the diagnosis of
disease while case presentations further emphasize the clinical
aspects of the pathologic processes.
