The mission of the SoD is to develop innovative and courageous artists and scholars poised to be the creative leaders of tomorrow.  We are committed to producing engaged citizens capable of contributing to a more creative, connected, and compassionate world.  The School’s graduates go on to careers in theatre, film, television, arts management, advertising, design, and creative media as well as other areas such as law, science and business where the artist’s skills of critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, entrepreneurship and creativity are essential.  The University of Washington serves a diverse population of 55,000 students including 31% first-generation college students, over 30% Pell Grant-eligible students, and faculty and staff from over 70 countries. As a Research I university (meaning the highest level of research activity), UW seeks to hire people with outstanding qualifications who are developing and/or maintaining an ongoing professional career at a national/international level. Seattle is a well-known center of innovation and culture, and the School of Drama enjoys a close relationship with the area’s many performing arts groups. The SoD currently has a professional production staff with expertise in the areas of scenery, paint, properties, electrics, sound, and costumes.
The successful candidate will be expected to utilize the tools of sound, music, and aural composition to tell stories via performance in three-dimensional space. The successful candidate will be expected to teach the foundations of sound design and aural storytelling and mentor students in sound design. Positive factors for consideration include, but are not limited to

Candidates who are visionary artists and teachers working at the forefront of their design field(s).
Candidates who are actively engaged in multiple design disciplines, whose creative practice is interdisciplinary, who come with strong backgrounds in collaborative practice, whose work experience includes devising, trans-medial or mixed reality performance practices, and/or embraces non-traditional and traditional approaches to staging and design.
The ability to teach music composition, sound editing/mixing, and/or projection design.  

We understand and acknowledge that people can come to the field of sound design from many different pathways.  We are particularly enthusiastic about applicants whose background and/or experience has included, but is not limited to, the following positive factors for consideration:

A demonstrated commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, and access. 
A demonstrated commitment to self-education, cultural awareness, and growth to solidify connections between faculty, students, and staff.
A rigorous approach to storytelling that focuses on live performance. 
Experience designing in multiple types of environments, which may include non-traditional, experimental, immersive, interactive, virtual and site-based performance as well as commercial theater, regional/LORT or international theater, opera, and dance.
Experience designing for film, games, art installation and/or other interdisciplinary creative work.
Three or more years of experience of successful teaching and/or mentoring of learners is ideal either within a one’s professional creative practice or a traditional academic setting with graduate and/or undergraduate students.
A commitment to an educational approach that stresses the value of collaboration between all members of a production team.
Eagerness to engage in the goals and values presented in the School of Drama’s Mission, Vision, Values, and Commitments.
Experience teaching other kinds of design courses such as projection, scenery, costumes, or lighting.

The Design program at the UW School of Drama prides itself on a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach to teaching, with many courses are rotated among the faculty.  Using an integrative approach to design, faculty will educate future artists with a rigorous dramaturgical approach, grounded in the technical craft of the field. The successful candidate will teach both graduate and undergraduate students (sometimes integrating both within a given course) and encounter a wide range of experience levels. Faculty in this position will teach some generalized courses such as Visual Narrative in Performance or Tools of Composition; contribute to graduate level courses such as Design Studio, Visual Communication, or Drafting; as well as other Digital Media and design courses related to their unique skillset, including potentially Projection Design. The program encourages interdisciplinary pedagogy and currently includes courses that are team-taught with faculty of two or more disciplines. 
 
Student designers are prioritized in the production season and faculty members act as advisors to student designers during school productions. On occasion faculty may also design within the season as needed, however, this is not a dominant aspect of the position. Faculty actively participate in the recruitment of prospective graduate students and often make use of their professional networks to assist students in finding productive internships or other kinds of professional connections. Participation in academic administrative work, including curricular development and committees, is expected along with other forms of service typical of a tenure-track faculty position. In addition to teaching and service, research and/or creative practice outside of ongoing university duties will be significant criteria in the assessment for promotion and tenure for the position.
Mission/EDIA Commitment
The School of Drama is committed to building and supporting a multicultural community that fosters equity, diversity, inclusion, and access. We aim for all members of our community to think critically about and engage actively with the world around them. To this end, we aim to embed engagement for our faculty, staff, and students with the ways that race, gender identity, sexuality, ability, class, and ethnicity intersect with and shape the human experience, both inside the educational experience and outside of it. The successful candidate will be expected to fulfill our commitment to equity and inclusion and have the confidence to effectively engage with students, staff, and community from a wide spectrum of backgrounds. The School of Drama has created and is committed to an Anti-Racist Action Plan, with which we encourage candidates to familiarize themselves. Our faculty and staff are expected to understand and embrace our commitment to respecting and representing diverse ideas, races, genders, sexualities, abilities, cultures, religions, and traditions, and to interrupt behaviors that hinder our work towards anti-racism and our diversity and inclusion efforts.

Assistant/Associate Professor in Mathematics Education


The School of Education (SOE) at the University of California,
Davis invites applications for a position at the rank of Assistant
or Associate Professor in the area of mathematics education.
Mathematics is a core discipline in educational institutions of all
kinds, and mathematical understanding is a critical component in
life, education, civic participation, and career. Mathematics also
serves as a powerful gatekeeper for other valued educational and
career pathways. Access to high quality mathematics learning
opportunities, however, is too scarce for all students, and
especially so for students marginalized along dimensions of racial
and ethnic background, socioeconomic resources, and regional
setting. Despite tremendous advances in recent years, we still have
much to learn about the nature of mathematical learning and
development, how to design effective mathematics learning
environments, how best prepare mathematics teachers, and to pursue
all of these goals in ways that address and rectify long-standing
patterns of injustice in education.

We seek a scholar committed to research that provides new and
transformative understandings of and solutions to persistent
challenges within K12 mathematics education.

Responsibilities: Conducting and maintaining a productive program
of research with the aims of advancing knowledge of mathematics
education; seeking extramural support for research and graduate
student support; teaching education courses in the graduate,
undergraduate, and teacher credentialing programs; and serving on
school and university committees.

The School of Education at the University of California, Davis
offers five Ph.D. program areas including Language, Literacy, and
Culture; Learning and Mind Sciences, Mathematics Education, Science
and Agricultural Education, and School Organization and Educational
Policy. In addition, we are home to two professional programs, the
Teacher Education Credential and MA program and the Capital Area
North Doctorate in Educational Leadership (CANDEL) EdD program, six
centers, and various research projects.

The University of California is committed to creating and
maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application,
and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through
academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in
University programs and activities can work and learn together in a
safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment,
discrimination, exploitation, or intimidation. With this
commitment, UC Davis conducts a reference check on all first choice
candidates for Academic Senate positions eligible for tenure or
security of employment. The reference check involves contacting the
administration of the applicant's previous institution(s) to ask
whether there have been substantiated findings of misconduct that
would violate the University's Faculty Code of Conduct. To
implement this process, UC Davis requires all applicants for any
open search for associate/full professor to complete, sign, and
upload the form entitled “Authorization to Release Information”
into RECRUIT as part of their application. If an applicant does not
include the signed authorization with the application materials,
the application will be considered incomplete, and as with any
incomplete application, will not receive further consideration.
Although all applicants for faculty recruitments must complete the
entire application, only finalists considered for positions at the
assistant rank, Step 4, 5, 6, as well as those eligible for tenure,
will be subject to reference checks.

Position Announcement

The University of Oregon's School of Journalism and Communication
(SOJC) is seeking an assistant professor of journalism with an
emphasis on reporting and writing—one who knows how to tell stories
with impact across digital platforms and who can help us shape the
next chapter of journalism education.

The ideal candidate could be a journalist with a master's degree
and a record of high-profile, award-winning work, or it could be
one who holds a Ph.D. and has significant professional experience
in journalism. In either case, the individual hired will help us
shape the future of the reporting-and-writing core of our
undergraduate major, teaching undergraduate courses focused on
reporting and writing but with an emphasis on reaching audiences
across a variety of digital platforms and innovative media
possibilities. This individual also will contribute to teaching in
our professional master's programs in Eugene and Portland—and, as
appropriate, in other areas of our undergraduate, M.A., and Ph.D.
programs.

Within the journalism sequence in the SOJC, we build on a
foundation of public service, social responsibility, and
journalism's fundamental role in a democracy. We aim to improve
society through high-quality, impactful, and accurate journalism.
For decades, a key hallmark of our program has been a renowned
emphasis on deeply reported written stories, with courses taught by
some of the best of the craft—the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalists, New York Times opinion writers, and bestselling
nonfiction authors. We seek to build on this history by hiring a
tenure-track faculty member with a demonstrated background of
strong reporting and compelling writing. We believe the core of
journalism presented on any platform begins with in-depth reporting
and foundational writing skills that translate to an array of
digital storytelling forms. The faculty member in this new position
must demonstrate the creativity, innovation, curiosity, and digital
savvy to help us chart a path forward as a destination journalism
school. We need someone who can build journalism's next chapter
from the best of its recent past.

Beyond teaching, the ideal candidate will possess a highly
acclaimed body of professional work and/or a promising trajectory
of peer-reviewed research appropriate for the position of
tenure-track assistant professor. They will also have a
demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion as well as to
forms of service, mentorship, and leadership appropriate for a
journalism program that emphasizes professional development,
experiential learning, and community engagement.

Where possible, the ideal candidate will strengthen our School's
reach and reputation in one or more of the following areas of
emphasis: news and storytelling for Latino/a/x groups and other
underrepresented populations; public affairs and accountability
journalism; science/environmental communication; sports
communication; audio storytelling; and virtual reality.

The SOJC places a strong emphasis on experiential learning.
Journalism students at SOJC participate in hands-on learning
through a wide variety of faculty-led, course-based publications as
well as through many independent student media (e.g., The Daily
Emerald). The assistant professor hired for this position should be
an enthusiastic coach who can help students find pathways to
publish their work in professional news publications.

The SOJC recently completed a multimillion-dollar renovation of
Allen Hall that includes an immersive media lab, podcast studio,
social media analytics lab, broadcast/photography studio and
screening room, and an e-sports broadcasting site.

The assistant professor hired for this role will teach 4 courses
per year (then 5 courses after promotion to associate professor).
They will be based at our Eugene campus, though with opportunities
to teach at our Portland campus and/or in virtual/hybrid modalities
as course needs allow.

About the University

The University of Oregon and the state of Oregon have traditionally
stood at the forefront of environmental movements and policy. This
newly established faculty position enables our research and
curriculum to address climate change resilience that is nimble,
creative, long-lasting, and socially responsible. We are dedicated
to the ethos that landscape architecture, focused on the human
imprint on this earth, avoids and mitigates climate changes by
providing innovative nature-based solutions, rather than immense,
expensive, and over-engineered strategies.

Pacific Northwest resilience can set an international standard, as
our coastal areas adapt to sea level rise. Oregon is also at the
center of climate change concerns regarding drought and wildfire.
Dwindling aquifers and snowpack portend a shift away from status
quo irrigation practices. Wildfire mitigation and wildfire recovery
also demand landscape solutions that involve and nurture local
communities.

The College of Design is a leader and exemplar on the University of
Oregon campus for our ongoing activities addressing diversity,
equity, and inclusion. The College is an international leader in
promoting the Spatial Justice Initiative, which brings visiting
scholars to the School of Architecture & Environment to teach
and research on spatial justice issues. Students and faculty in the
department of landscape architecture have crafted a DEI Toolkit,
which proactively guides our actions in making the department an
inclusive place to work and study. The College offers a supportive
and collaborative teaching and research environment, and actively
encourages applications from candidates from diverse
backgrounds.

The University of Oregon is located in the beautiful Willamette
Valley, with easy access to snow-capped mountains and scenic
coastlines. The University of Oregon is a comprehensive R1 research

About the Position
The Computer Science Department at Western Washington University (WWU) invites applications for two tenure-track positions beginning September 16, 2023 at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. All areas of specialization will be considered, but the department is particularly seeking candidates with research expertise and teaching interests in the following four areas:

Computer Systems: Computer Systems are a core of WWU’s offerings in computer science at the bachelor’s and graduate levels. Through the systems courses, students learn about the low-level workings of computing machines, which gives them a deep understanding of foundational CS principles. Topics taught across the multiple systems courses include foundational architecture principles, concurrency, and operating systems. Embedded systems and robotics are two electives that are offered at WWU.
Cybersecurity: WWU is recognized as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (CAE-C) by the NSA and DHS. WWU offers a BS in Cybersecurity, and is developing a BA in Cybersecurity and expanding graduate level offerings. WWU operates Cyber Range Poulsbo, the Washington State educational cyber range, and is the academic lead of PISCES, a national program through which students are cyber analysts protecting small governmental networks. WWU cooperates with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the Cyber and Information Security Agency (CISA), and the Naval Underwater Warfare Center (NUWC).
Data Science: Many of our faculty conduct research that involves the collection, processing, analysis, visualization and modeling of data, in areas such as machine learning, computer vision, computational neuroscience, information retrieval, bioinformatics, and natural and spoken language processing. Our department has established strong ties around data science to other departments on campus and to external organizations, such as Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. WWU currently offers a BS in Data Science and is seeking to build on this foundation to expand in both graduate and undergraduate offerings.
Theory and Algorithms: As part of the ABET-accredited BS in CS and the graduate program, the department offers courses on data structures, formal languages, and algorithm analysis. Topics such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, algorithmic complexity, NP-completeness, finite automata, and Turing machines are part of the undergraduate and graduate curriculum in algorithms and theory.

Work Life Balance: The department is committed to a balanced approach for faculty where research is encouraged and supported. High-quality engaged instruction is highly valued.

individual, community, or population health in urban contexts. The
successful candidate will be well versed in geographic and
interdisciplinary perspectives on both environmental health and
urban contexts and will share our broad understanding of health as
physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being influenced by
place and space. We are open to all methodological approaches but
will give preference to candidates with experience in innovative
and creative mixed and/or qualitative methods of gathering and
analyzing rich and diverse types of data that emphasize the
significance of geography in shaping health.

Candidates must have a demonstrated research focus on environmental
health geography in urban contexts and a commitment to working with
diverse groups through research, teaching, mentoring, and service.
Research expertise could include but is not limited to
environmental racism, environmental justice, climate migration,
climate-related health impacts, demography, health disparities,

urban development, community health, air quality, happiness and
quality of life, social reproduction, trauma, embodiment, political
ecology of the body, therapeutic landscapes, sustainable cities,
and child friendly cities in urban settings anywhere in the
world.

Given the growing diversity of fields that are contributing to
better understandings of urban and environmental health issues,
applicant disciplines may include but are not limited to the fields
of geography, anthropology, public health, ethnic studies,
sociology, urban studies, environmental studies, or food
studies.

health, media geographies, and gentrification. The successful
candidate will be expected to contribute to the Sustainability,
Urban Studies, and/or Food Studies programs, whose
interdisciplinary majors and/or minors depend heavily on teaching,
mentoring, and advising by geography faculty.


Qualifications
Candidates must have a doctoral degree in geography or related
discipline and a research and funding record of accomplishment that
demonstrates their ability to establish a clear program of
research. A history of experience with extramural funding from
federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, USDA) is preferred. Ideally,
candidates would have experience conducting research in
interdisciplinary environments. The Department of Geography and the
University will provide structured faculty development to assist
faculty in achieving success as independent researchers through
research training opportunities, community building among
interdisciplinary researchers, and mentorship support as faculty
work to establish their program of teaching, research, and service
at SDSU.

Teaching experience at the undergraduate and graduate levels is
desired but not required. Candidates should have a demonstrated
interest in teaching and mentoring students at the undergraduate
and graduate level, including master and doctoral students in
geography.

We are seeking applicants with demonstrated experience in and/or
commitment to teaching and working effectively with individuals

diversity statement how you meet at least two (2) of these
criteria. Additional guidance on our BIE program for applicants is
here.

SDSU’s Vibrant Research Environment

Collaborative, transdisciplinary, and trans-border research
opportunities abound at SDSU. SDSU is home to many Centers and
Institutes focused on the health of underrepresented
communities, with opportunities for community collaboration through
the Center for Regional
Sustainability. As a large and socially diverse city located
along the US-Mexico border, San Diego serves as an ideal hub for
research on urban and environmental health issues, with many
opportunities for collaboration in applied and community-based
research, including work with newly arrived immigrants and refugees
from many countries and Native American tribes and bands who have
lived in the area since time immemorial.

SDSU is home to a diverse student and faculty body. Over a third of
our approximately 36,000 students, both undergraduate and graduate,
are from underrepresented communities. SDSU is the oldest
institution of higher education in the San Diego region, with a
campus and microsites in San Diego and locations in Southern
California’s Imperial Valley and Tbilisi in the Republic of
Georgia. The highly diverse campus community has a student
population of approximately 36,000. SDSU is included in the
Carnegie Foundation’s Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity
category. Established in 1897, SDSU offers bachelor degrees in 97
areas, masters in 84 and doctorates in 23. See http://www.sdsu.edu for more
information. SDSU is a large, diverse, urban university and
Hispanic-Serving Institution with a commitment to diversity,
equity, and inclusive excellence. Our campus community is diverse
in many ways, including race, religion, color, sex, age,
disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, national origin, pregnancy, medical condition, and
covered veteran status. We strive to build and sustain a welcoming
environment for all.

SDSU strives for equity and inclusion in everything it does,
building on the human and intellectual diversity of students,
faculty, and staff as a source of innovation and strength. SDSU is
ranked 35 nationwide for ethnic diversity, and roughly 54 percent
of the university's undergraduates and graduates are students from
historically marginalized populations. SDSU is the No. 1
LGBTQ+-friendly campus in California, and No. 8 nationally,
according to Campus Pride and BestColleges. ​Further, the
university is consistently ranked as a top school for veterans and
serves more than 4,000 military-connected students. As a
U.S.-Mexico transborder Hispanic Serving Institution, SDSU launched
its Inaugural Global Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish in Spring 2021
to value and honor the language of our California/Baja California
region. Most critically, the values of equity, diversity, and
inclusion translate to results: Continuation and degree completion
rates have increased over the last decade, and equity gaps have
begun to close effectively with individuals from diverse
backgrounds.

The SDSU Mission Valley Innovation District will offer
opportunities for collaboration and entrepreneurship, with 1.6
million square feet of planned research and innovation space that
will be developed primarily through public and private
partnerships. SDSU researchers and Innovation District partners
will work together to develop creative solutions to complex
problems. SDSU’s entrepreneurship programs have the potential to
catalyze the public impact of research discoveries.

candidate statement on commitment to diversity

Diversity is a defining feature of California's past, present, and
future. Increasing the diversity of our educators to better reflect
the population of California is just one aspect of the College of
Education's dedication to just, equitable and inclusive education.
Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences, values,
and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and
circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender,
age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and
more.

All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an
integral component of curricular and pedagogical development to
enhance academic success. In this way, our students learn to value
and draw upon students' backgrounds not only to support them in
developing skills leading to success in the broader society, but
also as a mechanism to transform our schools and communities. We
believe that all faculty and staff who work for the College must
share these same commitments.

Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php
to learn more about Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE).

The diversity statement should focus on your commitment to a Just,
Equitable and Inclusive Education. The diversity statement will be
assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and expertise
as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have an
emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.)

This statement can take several different forms and should address
at least one of the following:
Your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE.
How you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities.
How you have personally experienced JEIE.
Your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

Finalists will be required to have three letters
of recommendation submitted. Please have these ready for the
referents to submit. On the References page of the online
application, enter information and email addresses for three
referents who will provide a confidential letter of reference for
your application. At the appropriate time in the search process,

uploading the letter. You will be able to verify that each letter
has been received by CSUF by logging back into your applicant
portal.

is August 2023.

students. As part of our work to create a just, equitable and
inclusive educational system, the College of Education at CSUF

programs, but candidates with P20 experience and expertise could

leadership model, with the expectation that all faculty share some
of the leadership responsibilities, though there are program
coordinators who carry the bulk of the program responsibilities.

monthly in department meetings. The MSHE program is selective,
admitting approximately 30% of its applicants through a holistic
admissions process. MSHE students bring a wide diversity of life
experiences and strengths, often in areas that are undervalued in
traditional educational settings. The MSHE program partners with
the City of Maywood to host an annual education fair for families
and community members numbering over 1,000. The department includes

Position Announcement

The University of Oregon's Department of Linguistics invites
applications for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in
Linguistics, to begin in fall 2023. We seek candidates specializing
in language description based on primary data collection, with
training and research orientation that will further our
department's commitment to functional/usage-based approaches to
linguistic explanation. We particularly welcome applications from
scholars who are members of Indigenous language communities or from
other populations historically underrepresented in the academy,
and/or whose life experience would contribute unique perspectives.
Similarly, we seek applicants who will contribute to excellence in
teaching students from diverse backgrounds at the undergraduate and
graduate levels.
Department or Program Summary

We are a growing department structured in its research and graduate
program around 3 broad themes: linguistic diversity & society;
language learning & technology; and language processing &
human health. We share a usage-based approach to understanding
language patterns, with strengths in functionalist approaches to
syntax, language description and revitalization, historical
linguistics, experimental linguistics, laboratory phonology,
language acquisition and teaching, and variationist
sociolinguistics. Most Ph.D. dissertation research at the
University of Oregon is in either language documentation (usually
describing languages not previously documented), experimental
research (including laboratory phonology, discourse studies,
gesture, and semantics), second language acquisition and teaching,
and, increasingly, language revitalization as a research endeavor.
See more at: https://linguistics.uoregon.edu/.
We are committed to principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Our racial justice statement and diversity action plan can be

excellence and to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Preferred Qualifications

Research: A successful candidate will have an established
program of field research on an under-described language or
language family, and will possess thorough knowledge of relevant
technology and software. We are open to specializations in any
subfield that is related to the analysis of morphosyntax and
semantics. We especially welcome candidates who specialize in the
analysis of language in use, broadly conceived. This can include
working on linguistic anthropology, discourse analysis, information
structure, small-corpus analysis, or any related topic. We are also
interested in scholars who will enhance the department's existing
strengths in historical linguistics, usage-based approaches to
syntax, laboratory phonology, applied linguistics, and language
revitalization, and/or who will complement our current expertise
with other strengths such as experimental and/or computational
approaches in fieldwork. The best applications will also highlight
the theoretical richness, typological relevance, or social
relevance of their research program in one or more areas of
linguistics.

undergraduate teaching. Candidates are asked to discuss their
approach to mentoring graduate students.

About the University

The University of Oregon has a long tradition of environmental
research and activism and is nationally known for our
interdisciplinary study of the environment. Environmental justice
in the U.S. has been a core concern of scholarship in environmental
studies, and this hire promises to add to the UO's expertise and to
expand our departmental focus. UO is also one of a shrinking number
of universities committed to teaching about racial, gender and
LGBTQ justice. Our university requires students to take courses
that focus on power and inequality. Our Provost has dedicated
university resources to advancing programs that support faculty who
teach these courses through awards, fellowships and mentorship. We
are especially interested in candidates, therefore, who can support
this work in mentoring, research, teaching, and outreach with
women, first-generation students, communities of color, and other
underrepresented groups. We encourage applications from all
qualified candidates, and strongly encourage women, faculty of
color, LGBTQIA faculty and faculty with disabilities to apply. All
applicants are requested to include in their cover letter
information about how they will contribute to this work.

members of the Association of American Universities and holds the

representing all 50 states and nearly 100 countries. In recent

Position Announcement

The Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of
Oregon invites applications for a tenure-track professor (open
rank) in Urban Ecological Justice. It is well-documented that
disadvantaged communities have significantly less access to clean
water, healthy food, moderated microclimates, sanitation, secure
shelter, flood control, waste collection, air quality, parks, urban
wildlife, and natural beauty. Climate change portends ever more
dangerous and unhealthy environments in the form of more frequent
flooding, food scarcity, housing displacement, heat waves, and
other threats particularly faced by low-income households. Despite
evidence of effective environmental solutions to social injustice,
a distinct gap remains in the research addressing implementation of
such solutions.

Well-designed landscape architecture solutions can foster improved
socioeconomic, physical health, mental health, and well-being by
providing public spaces derived from the desires, traditions, and
strengths of engaged community members. Thus, we welcome potential
faculty members to join with our faculty and students in addressing
inequities as we shape our world.

Teaching duties may include landscape design studios (graduate and
undergraduate), foundations, ecology, technical issues in landscape
design (e.g., site analysis, media, planting design), productive
landscapes (agriculture, forestry, food-forests) as well as courses
related to community engagement, spatial justice, food sovereignty,
and design for a sustainable world.

The 9-month academic year salary comes with a generous benefits
package. Typically, tenure-track faculty members teach five 11-week
courses or studios per year (slightly less than the semester
equivalent of four courses per academic year). New faculty members
have a reduced teaching load of four 11-week courses per year for
two years. Teaching, research, and service are 40%, 40%, and 20% of
the workload, respectively. Faculty often serve as advisors for
students, but most advising is provided by advising staff
members.
Department or Program Summary

The BLA, MLA, and PhD in Landscape Architecture programs at the
University of Oregon each provide rigorous, accredited curricula
combining theory, research, design skills, and extensive real-world
studio instruction so that students become effective and creative
leaders in the profession. A Bachelor of Environmental Design
degree is also in the planning phase. Landscape Architecture
programs are located on University of Oregon's main campus in
Eugene.

The College of Design is a leader and exemplar on the University of
Oregon campus for our ongoing activities addressing diversity,
equity and inclusion. The College is an international leader in
promoting the Spatial Justice Initiative, which brings visiting
scholars to the School of Architecture & Environment to teach
and research on spatial justice issues. Students and faculty in the
department of landscape architecture have crafted a DEI Toolkit,
which proactively guides our actions in making the department an
inclusive place to work and study. The College offers a supportive
and collaborative teaching and research environment and actively
encourages applications from candidates from diverse
backgrounds.
Minimum Requirements

Required qualifications include a master's degree in landscape
architecture, evidence of research productivity, and evidence of
teaching accomplishment.
Preferred Qualifications

Preferred qualifications are: PhD in Landscape Architecture or
related field; an accredited degree (BLA or MLA) in landscape
architecture; registration as a landscape architect.

The Cornell SC Johnson College of Business invites applications from qualified individuals for two Assistant Professor positions in the Applied Economics and Policy (AEP) area with an intended start date of July 1, 2023.  One of the positions will be based in Johnson with primary teaching responsibilities focused on MBA students.  The other will be based in Dyson with teaching primarily focused on Dyson’s undergraduate or graduate programs. These positions will be based in Ithaca, NY.
The responsibilities of these positions include producing high-quality research in the field of development economics; graduate student supervision, including the ability to guide field research in low- and middle-income countries; teaching introductory and advanced courses for various undergraduate and graduate programs offered by the college; securing external research grants or contracts; public outreach to help translate research into real world impact; and service to the academic community, the AEP area, the SC Johnson College of Business, and the University at large.  It is expected that our faculty teach across multiple schools within the College of Business.
The ideal candidate will possess a Ph.D. or be on track to completing one by summer 2023, in an economics or economics-related field, with a strong record of applied research in development economics and in teaching.

The Johnson School offers MBA, Executive MBA, MS, and Ph.D. programs. The Dyson School offers Cornell’s undergraduate business program, and is home to graduate (MPS, MS and Ph.D.) programs in applied economics and management.

AEP faculty frequently collaborate with colleagues in Strategy and Business Economics and other Areas within the College (e.g., Finance, Marketing), as well as with faculty from Agriculture and Life Sciences, Computer and Information Sciences, Economics, Engineering, Industrial and Labor Relations, Public Policy, and other units across campus. The College is also home to the Emerging Markets Institute and the Emerging Markets Program, which focus on business and economic development in emerging economies.

Position Announcement

The Department of Marketing in the Lundquist College of Business
seeks to fill three tenure-track faculty positions. Structurally,
two positions are intended for the assistant professor level and
one position at an advanced level (associate or full
professor).

The University of Oregon is supporting the Department of
Marketing's initiative to hire a cluster of scholars with aligned
research and teaching interests around the theme of “Marketing for
a Better World.” The marketing discipline is increasingly shifting
toward uncovering new ways marketing can address grand challenges
and be used for good, as represented by recent special issues in
premier marketing journals:

“Marketing has the power to improve lives, sustain livelihoods,
strengthen societies, and benefit the world at large.” —
Journal of Marketing's 2021 “Better Marketing for a Better World”
Special Issue.

“The grand challenges of climate change, widening inequalities
with respect to gender, race, and wealth, alongside current
healthcare, social, and economic crises are compelling
organizations to reimagine their marketing strategy to make a
meaningful contribution for a better world.” -- Journal of the
Academy of Marketing Science's announcement of its upcoming
“Reimagining Marketing Strategy: Driving the Debate on Grand
Challenges” Special Issue.

By adding three new faculty with scholarship, values, and interests
aligned to these topics and to the Department of Marketing's
existing faculty, the department hopes to grow a mutually
supportive community of scholars with overlapping values and sense
of purpose so that the department can better advance impactful
research and teaching. Ideally, the cluster hire will help the
department cover the full scope of marketing scholarship from
macro‐level to micro‐level, and includes the areas of modeling,
strategy and consumer behavior. This cluster hire aligns with the
University of Oregon Provost's Strategic Initiative on Environment
(https://environment.uoregon.edu/ihp‐criteria)
and Sport & Wellness (https://sportwellness.uoregon.edu/ihp‐criteria).

for a tenure-line faculty position in Educational Data Science and
Quantitative Methods to primarily serve in its Quantitative
Research Methods in Education (QRME) Ph.D. program. The successful
candidate for this endowed Petrone Professorship will be an
accomplished, innovative researcher, leader, and educator at the
Associate or Full Professor level.

We are seeking a colleague with expertise in educational data

program develops researchers, scholars, and policy leaders who
engage in traditions of inquiry that create knowledge and
understanding founded in large-scale and quantitative empirical
evidence. The program focuses on building a strong understanding of
quantitative methods, studying causal and complex relationships
within applied educational, social, and institutional settings, and
using research to inform policy and practice in applied educational
and social settings. Linked to the QRME PhD are two popular
graduate specializations: one in quantitative research methods for
PhD students outside QRME and one in Data Science. These
specializations serve doctoral students across the COE and

Given that the field of data science is evolving and fluid, we
invite applicants from a broad set of methodological backgrounds at
the intersection of inferential statistics, research design,
computer science, domain knowledge, and a variety of philosophical
perspectives. The successful candidate will be committed to
engaging in critical interdisciplinary dialogues. Preference will
be given to candidates whose work focuses on data science
applications to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and social
justice in education. We are equally committed to increasing the
diversity of our faculty. Scholars from historically marginalized
backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. If you are uncertain
whether you meet the position requirements, we strongly encourage
you to apply or to contact us to discuss relevant transferrable
skills.

Asian-American studies, Latinx studies, carceral studies,

poised for growth with additional hires scheduled for next year.
With more than 200 undergraduates majoring and minoring in our
allied programs (ethnic studies major and minor, Black studies
minor, Latinx studies minor, Native and Indigenous studies major
and minor) and a new IRES PhD program entering its second year, we
are one of the top ethnic studies degree-granting institutions in
the United States. In addition to our core faculty with tenure
homes in IRES, our graduate faculty spans multiple schools and
departments, augmenting our intellectual community for faculty and
students alike.

Please submit an application letter that outlines the candidate's
research interests; a CV; a sample syllabus; a statement on

Department or Program Summary

The research and teaching of the UO Department of Indigenous, Race,
and Ethnic Studies examines the ways that race, as a system of
domination, is intimately tied to issues of gender, class,
sexuality, migration, indigeneity, and colonialism. With our
students, we interrogate historical and contemporary manifestations
of White supremacy and explain how systems of domination and acts
of resistance create and recreate racial subjects.

While IRES traditionally centers the social construction of race in
the United States, it also pays significant attention to
transnational migrations and diasporas resulting from the slave
trade, indentured labor, colonialism, imperialism, and
globalization.
Minimum Requirements

Ph.D. (by time of appointment)
Demonstrated teaching experience and expertise within the allied
fields of Indigenous, race, and ethnic studies are required.
Preferred Qualifications

Demonstrated excellence in relational, comparative, intersectional,
and transdisciplinary scholarship.
About the University

University of Oregon is located in Kalapuya ilihi, the homelands of
Kalapuyan peoples who were forcefully removed by the US government
in the 1850s. Their descendants today are predominantly citizens of
the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde and the Confederated
Tribes of Siletz Indians, and they maintain active ties to this
region and our campus. Like every state, Oregon has a history
replete with racism against people of color, as well as a history
of resistance and complications that we continue to work through
and teach about as we strive to create a better future.

The University of Oregon has a student population of 22,298
undergraduate and graduate students. Of these, 32% are students of
color. The university makes institutional commitments to diversity

the Many Nations Longhouse, the Center for Latino/a and Latin
American Studies, the Multicultural Center, and the Division of
Equity and Inclusion, among other initiatives.

Department or Program Summary

This is part of an 11 position faculty cluster hire for the
University of Oregon's Environment Initiative, a coordinated
campus-wide effort launched by the top-tier research university in
2022 to create an intellectual hub for a just and livable future.
The Department of Architecture is part of the School of
Architecture & Environment in the College of Design and has
been recognized as a leader in the field of sustainability since
the 1960s, offering B.Arch., M.Arch., M.S. degrees and a Ph.D. in
Sustainable Design. . It examines how design of the physical
environment can repair the natural environment, regenerate
communities and elevate the human spirit. Broad societal challenges
are addressed through the lens of specific clients, locations and
ecosystems. Established in 1914, the UO School of Architecture and
Allied Arts was one of the first to break away from Beaux-Arts
pedagogy to emphasize non-competitive, individualized education.
Faculty are committed to creating a student-centered learning
community that embraces multiple viewpoints. It is a department in
which learning, research, and professional activity inform each
other; in which new ideas and established traditions are in
dialogue.

The College of Design's unique academic ecosystem includes diverse
disciplines to engage complex problems such as designing for all
life-forms. It comprises not only creative
practitioners—architects, artists and designers—but also social
scientists, humanities scholars, engineers, economists, biologists,
planners, and policy makers. The School of Architecture &
Environment includes the Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and
Interior Architecture departments on the University's Eugene,
Oregon main campus. The campus is located about 65 miles from the
Pacific coast and the Cascade mountains and 110 miles south of
Portland. With visionary leadership in urban design and
transportation policies, the Portland branch campus is the urban
laboratory for the Department of Architecture and the Historic
Preservation program. Both Portland and Eugene are
socially-progressive, bike-friendly, healthy, green, and
family-friendly cities with ambitious goals for carbon emissions
reduction and for community wellbeing. For more information on the
school and department, please visit: https://archenvironment.uoregon.edu/

In 2019, Oregon was the first to pass a statewide mandate to
increase housing choices by allowing forms of multi-family housing
on previously single-family residential lots. Leadership is needed
to show how the resulting 2022 housing code changes can benefit
communities regionally and globally. This position builds on the UO
Graduate Housing Specialization that was recognized with a National
Honor Award for Housing Design Education given by Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) and the American
Institute of Architects (AIA) in 2016. and on the department's
stature in sustainable, healthy, and just built environments.

The successful candidate will support and enhance a diverse
learning and working environment. We particularly welcome
applications from scholars who are from groups historically
underrepresented in the academy, and/or who have experience working
with populations from historically and persistently underserved
communities. To broaden perspectives and conversations, the School
of Architecture welcomed its first cohort of Design for Spatial

Department Summary

The Robert D. Clark Honors College (CHC) is a liberal arts honors
college within the University of Oregon. Founded in 1960, it is one
of the oldest public university honors colleges in the United
States. The College features a newly restructured curriculum that
provides students a strong interdisciplinary foundation in the
liberal arts, as well as a series of signature programs, including
Calderwood Seminars in Public Writing, the Inside-Out Prison
Exchange Program, and an Academic Residential Community. CHC
courses are typically run as seminars. They are writing-intensive
and open only to honors college students. Courses are capped at 19
students, allowing for vibrant intellectual discussions, unique
opportunities for pedagogical experimentation and extensive
faculty-student interaction.

The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the
traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Following
treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people were dispossessed
of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and
forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon. Today,
Kalapuya descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated
Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz
Indians, and they continue to make important contributions to their
communities, to the UO, to Oregon, and to the world.

Position Announcement

The Department of Global Studies at the University of Oregon seeks
a full-time, tenure-track Assistant Professor in Global Political
Economy to start in Fall 2023. We seek a scholar who holds a Ph.D.
in a relevant social science, humanities, or interdisciplinary
program by the time of appointment and whose expertise addresses
one or more of these areas in qualitative and/or quantitative
perspective: economic globalization and its political and social
impacts; international political economic institutions and
processes; debt, dependency, and the legacies of colonization; and
the relationships between global political economy, human
development, and development strategies and policies. We are
especially interested in candidates who take critical,
interdisciplinary, and decolonial approaches to the global
political economy; and whose teaching and research complement core
foci in our department, including food systems, education, global
health and wellbeing, and environment and climate change. In their
application materials, candidates should address how their work
supports the diversity and equity goals of the department and the
university, should describe a robust research agenda, and should
demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in a language appropriate
for their regional specialization. We particularly welcome
applications from scholars who identify with populations
historically underrepresented in the academy and/or who have a
proven record of mentoring students from underrepresented
backgrounds.

The standard teaching load is five courses on the quarter system,
with course reductions usual for pre-tenure faculty. In addition to
teaching a core undergraduate course, Globalization and the Global
Economy, the successful candidate will develop other undergraduate
and graduate courses that explore political and economic
transformations and their consequences in global comparative and
regionally specific perspectives. Global Studies students bring a
rich array of backgrounds, identities and experiences to the
Department, including but not limited to international students,
first-generation students, Dreamers, differently abled and
non-traditional students and students from underrepresented ethnic
and gender identities. The successful candidate must therefore have
a demonstrated ability to work effectively and respectfully with
students, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds and a strong
record of professional activities that contribute to diversity,
equity, and inclusion.
Department or Program Summary

The Department of Global Studies thrives as an interdisciplinary
undergraduate and Master's program with connections across all
colleges and schools of the University of Oregon, and is a pivotal
component of the new School of Global Studies and Languages. We are
known for our curricular and research innovation and ethically
informed community engagement. Department faculty and students
conduct research fundamentally oriented toward intercultural
understanding from their differing social science perspectives.
Opportunities exist for research and teaching in connection with
the UO's regional research programs and centers, for example in
Latin American, African, and Asian Studies. New faculty are
supported through the UO's year-long professional development
program, access to the National Center for Faculty Development and
Diversity “bootcamp” program, and a structured departmental
mentorship.

Essential to this position is the expectation of contributing to the teaching mission in both departments through the development of new undergraduate and/or graduate level courses that align with the candidate’s area of expertise. While the candidate will be expected to participate in both the Zoology & Physiology and Animal Science departments, the physical home will be based on the candidate’s research and teaching expertise.  
 
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNCTIONS:

The Scripps Gerontology Center is celebrating its 100th year with a mission “to do work that makes a positive difference in the lives of aging individuals, their families and communities, and to meet the needs of aging societies.” Miami’s record of external funding with state, federal, and private foundations on applied policy and evaluation topics in aging has generated $20 million in external funding over the last three decades.

The College of Visual and Performing Arts (CVPA) at James Madison University (JMU) invites applications for a cohort hire comprising eleven positions.
These positions constitute an integrative arts cohort hire. We conceive of integrative arts as combining artistic and/or disciplinary perspectives and/or practices around contemporary issues. This may include—but is not limited to—cross- inter-, multi-, and/or trans-disciplinary work. Our cohort will collaborate to develop courses, curricula, and research agendas that promote integrative arts and design practices and advance justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and access (viewed through lenses that may include, but are not limited to culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, sexuality, and/or veteran status). These individuals will complement and expand CVPA strengths in anti-bias/anti-racist pedagogy, artmaking, arts and technology, community engagement, culturally-sustaining practice, design justice, design thinking, educator preparation, entrepreneurial thinking, and design- or arts-based research.

Cohort members will have primary appointments in one of the college’s three academic units (i.e., Art, Design, and Art History; Music; Theatre and Dance) most aligned with their disciplinary focus. Their work will be supported with a biennial course release to collaborate with cohort colleagues and interested current faculty members to develop integrative arts courses that enroll students within and beyond their academic unit.
With over 100 full-time faculty and 1,200 full-time majors, CVPA brings together Schools of Art, Design, and Art History (SADAH); Music (SOM); and Theatre and Dance (STAD). CVPA also houses the Office of Creative Propulsion, which supports students and faculty in ideating, launching, and refining arts- and/or design-based efforts that reimagine and disrupt traditional practices, stretch and break artistic boundaries, and promote more equitable and inclusive opportunities for meaningful arts/design engagement. CVPA believes that equity, access, and inclusion are moral imperatives and artistic obligations. Diversity—in the stories we represent, students we serve, and audiences we engage—is vital for the health and relevance of contemporary arts and design practice. CVPA, therefore, welcomes diversity of perspective, ethnicity, race, religion, socio-economic status, gender identity, sexual orientation and ability. Across its units, CVPA is committed to empowering students to act boldly, justly, and inclusively to create their own unique path.
Teaching responsibilities could include introductory, upper-division undergraduate, studio, laboratory, and graduate instruction. Preference will be given to applicants who demonstrate an ability to develop and teach one or more integrative arts courses for undergraduate students, and/or engage with undergraduate or graduate student researchers. Successful candidates are expected to initiate and maintain an active research program that is appropriate to their discipline. Collaboration with other cohort members and/or faculty beyond CVPA is expected.
Applicants will have a terminal degree in a relevant discipline, and the potential for vibrant, collaborative teaching and scholarship at our primarily undergraduate institution. Consideration may be given to ABDs at the advanced dissertation stage who exhibit particularly compelling records. Unless otherwise indicated in the position-specific required qualifications for each position, applicants with extensive professional experience in lieu of a relevant terminal degree may be considered, with the expectation that any successful candidate not holding a terminal degree must complete a relevant terminal degree prior to achieving tenure.

The Climate Jobs Institute’s research and educational programming will support the State of Illinois’s transition to a strong, equitable decarbonized economy.

Identifying how to expand access to high-quality clean energy jobs for environmental justice communities and other frontline communities that have faced historical inequities (e.g., best practices for building pipelines of workers through on-the-job training programs, job hubs, and apprenticeship programs).
Assessing the types of support that local governments will need to help communities develop their own community energy, climate and jobs plans.
Evaluating initiatives, identifying research support and promulgating best practices for specific programs (e.g., Public Schools Carbon-Free Assessment programs).
Collaborating with related Institutes and Centers at the University of Illinois on joint/interdisciplinary research, policy recommendations, academic publications, and external funding proposals related to clean energy initiatives.

Diversity is a defining feature of California's past, present,
and future. Increasing the diversity of our educators to better
reflect the population of California is just one aspect of the
College of Education's dedication to just, equitable and inclusive
education. Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences,
values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and
circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender,
age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and
more.
All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an
integral component of curricular and pedagogical development to
enhance academic success. In this way, our students learn to value
and draw upon students' backgrounds not only to support them in
developing skills leading to success in the broader society, but
also as a mechanism to transform our schools and communities. We
believe that all faculty and staff who work for the College must
share these same commitments. Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php

(JEIE).
The diversity statement should focus on your commitment to a
Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education. The diversity statement
will be assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and
expertise as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have
an emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.)
This statement can take several different forms and should
address at least one of the following:
Your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE.
How you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities.
How you have personally experienced JEIE.
Your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

The College of Visual and Performing Arts (CVPA) at James Madison University (JMU) invites applications for a cohort hire comprising eleven positions.
These positions constitute an integrative arts cohort hire. We conceive of integrative arts as combining artistic and/or disciplinary perspectives and/or practices around contemporary issues. This may include— but is not limited to—cross- inter-, multi-, and/or trans- disciplinary work. Our cohort will collaborate to develop courses, curricula, and research agendas that promote integrative arts and design practices and advance justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and access (viewed through lenses that may include, but are not limited to culture, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, sexuality, and/or veteran status). These individuals will complement and expand CVPA strengths in anti-bias/anti-racist pedagogy, artmaking, arts and technology, community engagement, culturally-sustaining practice, design justice, design thinking, educator preparation, entrepreneurial thinking, and design- or arts-based research.
Cohort members will have primary appointments in one of the college’s three academic units (i.e., Art, Design, and Art History; Music; Theatre and Dance) most aligned with their disciplinary focus. Their work will be supported with a biennial course release to collaborate with cohort colleagues and interested current faculty members to develop integrative arts courses that enroll students within and beyond their academic unit.
With over 100 full-time faculty and 1,200 full-time majors, CVPA brings together Schools of Art, Design, and Art History (SADAH); Music (SOM); and Theatre and Dance (STAD). CVPA also houses the Office of Creative Propulsion, which supports students and faculty in ideating, launching, and refining arts- and/or design-based efforts that reimagine and disrupt traditional practices, stretch and break artistic boundaries, and promote more equitable and inclusive opportunities for meaningful arts/design engagement. CVPA believes that equity, access, and inclusion are moral imperatives and artistic obligations. Diversity—in the stories we represent, students we serve, and audiences we engage—is vital for the health and relevance of contemporary arts and design practice. CVPA, therefore, welcomes diversity of perspective, ethnicity, race, religion, socio-economic status, gender identity, sexual orientation and ability. Across its units, CVPA is committed to empowering students to act boldly, justly, and inclusively to create their own unique path.
Teaching responsibilities could include introductory, upper-division undergraduate, studio, laboratory, and graduate instruction. Preference will be given to applicants who demonstrate an ability to develop and teach one or more integrative arts courses for undergraduate students, and/or engage with undergraduate or graduate student researchers. Successful candidates are expected to initiate and maintain an active research program that is appropriate to their discipline. Collaboration with other cohort members and/or faculty beyond CVPA is expected.
Applicants will have a terminal degree in a relevant discipline, and the potential for vibrant, collaborative teaching and scholarship at our primarily undergraduate institution. Consideration may be given to ABDs at the advanced dissertation stage who exhibit particularly compelling records. Unless otherwise indicated in the position-specific required qualifications for each position, applicants with extensive professional experience in lieu of a relevant terminal degree may be considered, with the expectation that any successful candidate not holding a terminal degree must complete a relevant terminal degree prior to achieving tenure.
