POSITION DESCRIPTION
The Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Department (https://cres.ucsc.edu) at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications
for an Assistant/Associate Professor of Indigenous Studies. We seek
a scholar whose work is grounded in Indigenous epistemologies and
worldviews and engages anti/decolonial and Indigenous studies
methods, theories, and pedagogical approaches. Training in
Indigenous Studies at the bachelor's, master's, and/or doctoral
levels is welcome. Ideal candidates will have experience in and
commitment to working collaboratively with Indigenous
communities.

We are open to community-driven, collaborative, place-based work
with Indigenous peoples, whether in North America, the Americas,
borderlands, the Pacific, or elsewhere around the globe, and we
welcome a focus on California Indian perspectives. Potential areas
in which this scholar could work, among many other areas of focus
and expertise, are global Indigeneity; sovereignty struggles;
climate justice; settler colonialism; anticolonial movement
building; tribal law and CRT; displacement, diaspora, and
migration; gender and sexuality; public health; art and visual
culture; prisons and policing; native epistemologies and
pedagogies; creative/critical approaches to Indigenous studies; and
comparative approaches to Indigenous studies. The area of research
specialization is ultimately open.

This position carries a five-course equivalency workload, which
typically translates to teaching four courses scheduled over three
quarters and entails carrying other academic and service
responsibilities to the department, division, and campus.
Candidates should be prepared to teach regularly in both large
lecture and advanced seminar course formats in the CRES core
curriculum.

Beyond teaching responsibilities, this position requires a
demonstrated commitment or clearly stated interest in programmatic
and curricular development, in the service of strengthening and
collaboratively building Indigenous studies at UC Santa Cruz. For
this reason, we seek a scholar who is willing and has ideas about
how both to collaborate with other programs, departments, and
initiatives, including the American Indian Resource Center and the
Indigenous Faculty Network on campus, and to deepen and expand
CRES's commitment to community engagement.

UC Santa Cruz values diversity, equity, and inclusion and is
committed to hiring faculty who will work to advance these values.
UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian
American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution
(AANAPISI) with a high proportion of first-generation students. We
welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing historically
oppressed groups in higher education (as evidenced by life
experiences and educational background) and who can clearly
articulate participation in equity and diversity advancement
efforts with respect to teaching, mentoring, research, and service
towards building an equitable and scholarly environment. Activities
promoting equity and inclusion at UC Santa Cruz will be recognized
as important university service during the faculty promotion
process. More information can be found: https://apo.ucsc.edu/diversity.html

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

Department: https://cres.ucsc.edu

QUALIFICATIONS

The Energy and Resources Group (ERG) at the University of

Assistant Professor nine-month faculty position, in the area of
economics and the environment.

ERG is a graduate group within the Rausser College of Natural

address society's most complex problems, and collaborative research
that goes beyond traditional disciplinary domains is encouraged and
nurtured.

In keeping with the ERG mission, while this proposed position is
fundamentally about economics and the environment, it is broader
than the discipline of economics alone, and may go beyond what is
conventionally understood to be “environmental economics”. ERG's
interest is in a junior scholar anchored in economics.

Potential topics of research could include: remote sensing, data
science, climate economics, water, path dependencies, energy
systems, or just transitions.

The Energy and Resources Group values diversity, equity, and
inclusion as exemplified by the following principles of community:
we recognize the intrinsic relationship between diversity and
excellence in all our endeavors; we embrace open and equitable
access to opportunities for learning and development as our
obligation and goal.

ERG is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty,
including dual career couples and single parents. We are also
interested in candidates who have had non-traditional career paths
or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved
excellence in careers outside academia. For information about
potential relocation to Berkeley, or career needs of accompanying
partners and spouses, please visit: http://ofew.berkeley.edu/new-faculty

It does not matter if you do not meet every single preferred
criterion. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive
faculty body, so if you are excited about being at UC Berkeley but
your past experience does not align perfectly with every preferred
qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply
anyway.

A doctoral degree or pursuing a doctoral degree in a relevant
field.
Have a record of excellent research that crosses disciplinary
boundaries, with the potential to develop an
internationally-recognized research program that includes

insights to understanding the intertwined nature of sustainability
and equity, and who will further the interdisciplinary
conversations that define ERG

Job Summary
""Salt Lake Community College will be a model for inclusive and

Salt Lake Community College educates more than 60,000 students each
year – few institutions in Utah have a more significant impact on
the state's economy, workforce and education pipeline. SLCC is a
place where high school graduates can take their first step into
higher education, and where students can receive training and learn
skills to take them directly into the workforce. SLCC is dedicated
to engaging and supporting students from all cultures, abilities,
and ages, including underserved, first generation, and refugee
students, as well as English language learners from around the
world. About 70% of SLCC students work while attending college, 56%
are the first in their family to attend college, and 25% are from
ethnic minorities. Rapidly changing student demographics, with
increases in students from Hispanic/Latino/Latina backgrounds, have
made the imperative to close achievement gaps for students of color
a top priority for the entire college.

Salt Lake Community College seeks to attract an active, culturally
and academically diverse faculty of the highest caliber, with
demonstrated commitment to excellence in teaching, professional
growth, and service. The successful applicant will join an
innovative, collaborative, and diverse academic division, whose

teachers in their respective fields. They participate in their

scholars and reflective teachers. SLCC faculty members actively
serve students in developing the knowledge and skills they need to
lead meaningful, engaged lives, including successful and rewarding
careers in the area of their choosing.

social justice and issues of equity. The division includes programs

teach 14-15 credit hours per semester (30 per academic year) of

areas of expertise, and we are especially interested in candidates
who can contribute courses in the areas of International and Global
Studies, Disability Studies, Ethnic Studies, Gender Studies, and

and interest in building opportunities for undergraduate research

accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:

Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.

science”.

Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in the example do
not EXACTLY MATCH the degree listed in the minimum qualifications
section, this candidate MUST complete the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) in order to be
considered. When completing the form, be sure to explain in detail
how your qualifications are equivalent to the required minimum
qualifications. Do not assume that you do not need to submit a
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency because your degree is
similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

Candidates’ research portfolios could focus on any level of the preschool through higher education (PK-16) system. Their work should advance HGSE’s commitment to educational equity and to an assets-based approach highlighting both the contributions of students with disabilities and the societal and educational benefits of inclusion.
Advancing educational outcomes for all learners, including students with disabilities requires progress at the institutional, organizational, and classroom level. With this in mind, we particularly seek candidates who have expertise in the following areas: state and/or federal policy implementation and evaluation; inclusive learning environments; universal design for learning; identification processes and support services; least restrictive environments; school improvement strategies; approaches to professional learning; innovations in curriculum and instruction; adaptive technologies; addressing disproportionality in special education; and redesigning and/or personalizing learning environments.
We also seek candidates who have the potential to make a powerful contribution to the core curriculum for our master’s and doctoral programs, by teaching required courses and recommended elective courses as part of specific program pathways. In particular, the successful candidate is likely to take a teaching leadership role for a Disability in Context module, which is one of a series of six core modules offered as part of the Equity and Opportunity foundational course requirement for all entering master’s students. The Disability in Context module explores the social and cultural forces that lead to the discrimination and exclusion of individuals with disabilities, with a focus on actions and strategies to disrupt these forces.
The ability to convey conceptual as well as practical knowledge beyond one’s own specific expertise is crucial. High-quality teaching is highly valued at HGSE, and the school has made a strong commitment to cultivating and supporting strong teaching practices among faculty, primarily through the work of the school’s Teaching and Learning Lab. The successful candidate will have the potential to be a strong contributor to the development and delivery of residential and online professional development programs for practitioners, administrators, and leaders through HGSE’s Programs in Professional Education. The successful candidate will also be expected to contribute to HGSE initiatives focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
HGSE faculty at all ranks advise students and participate in institutional governance and service. Candidates will normally possess a doctorate or another terminal degree. Successful candidates will have substantial teaching and leadership experience; for the rank of Professor (with tenure), candidates must have an excellent record of rigorous scholarship and a robust program of research. For the rank of Assistant/Associate Professor (untenured), candidates should have emerging programs of research. The search committee will begin reviewing applications on November 7, 2022 and will continue until the position is filled. Please submit a CV, cover letter, statement of teaching philosophy, and three or more representative publications online at http://apply.interfolio.com/113793.

Indiana University Bloomington
The Interior Design faculty at Indiana University Bloomington seek a new colleague for a tenure-track faculty position in Interior Design.  We seek individuals whose perspective, scholarship, and/or built work advances the understanding of interior design as a human-focused, culturally contextualized, and ecologically aware discipline.  We believe design links humanity.
The Interior Design faculty is comprised of colleagues committed to providing insightful, engaged, contextualized, innovative, and inspiring teaching and learning.  The Interior Design faculty is widely recognized for pedagogical excellence, including university-level teaching awards.
The Interior Design faculty is also focused on developing and sharing design and design scholarship that informs, alters, and enhances interior design for people and society.
The Interior Design program is situated within the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design and the College of Arts & Sciences.  This location contextualizes our approach to design with a rich liberal arts background and a deep, cross-disciplinary exploration of art and design.  The Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design (Eskenazi School) (https://eskenazi.indiana.edu/) is composed of diverse scholars and practitioners at the forefront of integrative design thinking and practice.  The Eskenazi School houses six undergraduate degree programs in art, design, and merchandising, as well as graduate degree programs in art, architecture, and merchandising.  This is where art, merchandising, architecture, and design merge to shape the future of creativity from imagination to implementation.
The Eskenazi School is committed to building and supporting a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community of students and scholars.
Our School mission reads:
We are the nexus of art, architecture, design, and merchandising at Indiana’s flagship university—advancing research, creative activity, and education in our state and beyond.  As a trans-disciplinary community of ethical leaders, we embrace the liberal arts, encourage risk-taking, inspire innovation, and fuel creativity in a complex world.
In examining its responsibilities, the Eskenazi School has noted: 
“Historically, many artists and designers…found their voice in large part through questioning or being excluded themselves by societal norms and prejudices.  The Eskenazi School is, therefore, IU’s hub for fields that have consistently been at the forefront of counter culture and share a unique history for critical engagement with racism, gender and LGBTQ+ issues, economic disparities, equal rights, and other vital concerns, both urgently timely and inherently timeless.  ...The Eskenazi School acknowledges academia in the United States exists within a space of white privilege; and we are not an exception.  The predominately white nature of our School, the creative fields, and academia is detrimental to our community as a whole.  The lack of diversity not only affects those that have been continually marginalized by way of exclusion and abuse, but it also compromises the humanity, research, and teaching of all our faculty, staff, and students.  Due to the undying efforts of people who continue to fight for a better society, many are waking up to the difference between how we see ourselves and how others experience us…Our privileged idea of higher education will only change if the culture and thought of Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and all people, are able to thrive freely.  …The Eskenazi School actively upholds diversity, equity, and inclusion as critical principles of our research, teaching, and service.  We validate the voice and potential of every member of our community, strive to create a culture where difference is valued, and celebrate multiple perspectives within and beyond the School.  We believe social and cultural consciousness inspires meaningful dialogue and empowers all to become influential and fulfilled citizens of the world.”
Founded in 1820, Indiana University Bloomington is the flagship campus of IU’s eight campuses statewide. Innovation, creativity, and academic freedom are hallmarks of our world-class contributions in research and the arts.
The Eskenazi School houses fourteen different areas in art, design, and merchandising. This is where art, merchandising, architecture, and design merge to shape the future of creativity from imagination to implementation.

Sponsored by the Provost’s Office, these positions are part of a cluster hiring initiative that will include two positions in Social Work and two in the School of Theatre, Music, and Dance. The cluster hire aims to advance anti racist, social justice-focused, collaborative research involving different units across campus.
The intersection of art and social justice is an emerging area of research for the social work profession. We are particularly interested in candidates whose research address some of the following priorities: (1) expertise in an area of social work research (e.g., HIV prevention, child  welfare, etc.); (2) demonstrated interest in and experience with integrating art-forms and performance based work (e.g., spoken word, theater, documentary photography) in their research as a method of intervention and/or dissemination; (3) expertise in community-engaged research; (4) a focus on community organizing and other strategies for community change; and (5) antiracism and social justice practices.
A key feature of these positions is the opportunity to participate in the development of an Arts and Social Justice Collaboratory in partnership with existing faculty at the School of Social Work who already work in these areas and at the School of Music, Theater, and Dance. We look for scholars who use art-forms and performance as research methods, vehicles for engaging communities, and/or disseminating research findings. We look for strength-based research, community empowerment approaches and theories, arts and activism, educational justice, youth empowerment, and environmental justice. Select candidates will join existing programs at the School and University devoted to community engagement, arts leadership, and arts-based social work research, practice and education.
Requirements for the two open-rank positions include: strong research agenda and experience with research proposal development; peer reviewed publications focused on at least one of the research priorities listed above; teaching experience; a commitment to antiracist and social justice art-focused research, equity and inclusion; and a Ph.D. (preferably in social work). A record of work in and with community-based organizations is desirable, as well as as well as engaged scholarship that focuses on change at the community level. For the associate and full professor ranks, requirements also include demonstrated achievement in research and in successful teaching at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. We encourage applications from senior researchers, assistant professors, and advanced PhD candidates with strong research agenda and teaching experiences.

We seek outstanding applicants who will contribute to the School’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan. Michigan Social Work faculty members strive to be leaders in scholarship, education, and service for socially just communities in Michigan, the United States, and across the world. They respond to social challenges in this highly politicized and technologized world by supporting scholarly and academic excellence; equity in education, health and social services; and they draw on scientific and critical theories that support the understanding of social challenges and then work to develop translational solutions to these challenges. We seek new faculty members whose interests and commitments fit this philosophy. For more information about the University’s diversity initiative please visit: https://ssw.umich.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion.
Interested candidates should visit the online application to submit their cover letter, including the names of three references, a copy of their CV and three writing examples. Writing examples may include published works, visual and performing arts, media works, syllabi or detailed schedules for courses and workshops, case examples, and opinion pieces.

Read more about our work here: https://transform.utah.edu/pi-studies/ Per-capita, Utah has the largest number of Pacific Islanders in the continental United States and a vibrant, diverse Pacific Islander community. In our understanding, Pacific Islanders include the Indigenous peoples of the islands of the three regions known as Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean; from Palau in the west through Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the east. The successful candidate will find numerous opportunities for interaction with a range of civic organizations, given Salt Lake City’s role as the governmental and social nerve center of the state.

The School for Cultural and Social Transformation (Transform) is a recently formed interdisciplinary college committed to cutting-edge thinking about shifting sexualities, changing genders, dynamic immigrations, and emergent struggles against racist thought and action: https://transform.utah.edu/. Additionally integral to Transform are Disability Studies and the Pacific Islands Studies Initiative. Transform is also home to Frontiers, A Journal of Women Studies, one of the oldest feminist journals in the country. It also administers the Diversity Scholars Program, a cohort program that supports underrepresented and first-generation college students, providing faculty mentorship and off-campus community engagement opportunities. Transform seeks a dynamic scholar whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to its core goals of innovating scholarship and putting theory into practice. 

The University of Utah is the flagship institution of the Utah System of Higher Education and has been classified by the Carnegie Foundation as among those research universities with the ""highest research activity."" The University provides numerous opportunities for internal research funding and offers generous benefits and retirement packages: https://www.hr.utah.edu/benefits/. The University also recently launched a new program to help benefits-eligible staff purchase a home. The University's centers, including the Black Cultural Center, American Indian Resource Center, the Center for Student Equity & Student Belonging, collectively support and advocate for staff, students, and faculty who connect with Black, Native, Indigenous, and communities of color experiences through research, culturally-affirming education initiatives, and service. 

The University is located in Salt Lake City, the center of a metropolitan area with a population of approximately 1.25 million residents. Salt Lake City is home to sizable Latinx and immigrant populations (21.5% and 11.5% of residents, respectively). Per capita, Salt Lake City has the 11th largest LGBTQ population in the U.S. The city's proximity to the Wasatch Mountains, world-class ski resorts, and national parks makes it an ideal location for outdoor recreation. The Salt Lake City International Airport is a major hub with direct flights to most U.S. cities and direct international flights to a number of major cities. SLC has extensive arts and cultural activities. The area has received international recognition for its new light rail system, foodie culture, Sundance Film Festival, downtown renewal, and increasing diversity.

Position Description


The Department of Performance, Play & Design (PPD) (formerly
Theater Arts Department) (https://theater.ucsc.edu) at the University of
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for an Assistant
Professor of Playwriting with a specialization in Black Theater.
The successful candidate will teach technique courses in our
playwriting curriculum and specialized courses in their expertise
such as: Black diasporic theatre, Global Black playwriting, the
African American canon, interactive narrative, and/or playwriting
as social practice.

Previously a Theater Arts department (Design, Acting, Directing,
Dance, Playwriting, History/Theory/Dramaturgy), we have recently
merged with the Art & Design: Games and Playable Media program.
The Department, comprising 17 nationally and internationally
recognized faculty members, is positioned at the intersection of
storytelling, world building, and cross-platform, interdisciplinary
collaborations. It is our Department’s aim and high priority to
provide a curriculum that is actively anti-racist, intersectional
feminist, and decolonial in its approaches to storytelling,
teaching, and administration. We offer two BA degrees and a MA
degree that emphasize creative collaboration,
risk-taking/experimentation, critical/systemic thinking, rigor,
agency, embodiment, and practice-as-research proficiencies. The
Department also intersects with the MFA Digital Arts and New Media
program through the Future Stages research group, headed by
director Marianne Weems. For more on our department’s social
justice values, please visit: https://theater.ucsc.edu/programs/about-department
and https://arts.ucsc.edu/page/arts-division-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-statement.

We have a strong preference for candidates with expertise in the
pedagogies, traditions, and histories of playwriting as inclusive,
and those with an interest in working across both digital and live
platforms. Because we are committed to equitable practices with
regards to race, class, gender, sexuality, neurodiversity, ability,
and religion, we are particularly interested in
scholar-practitioners who have demonstrated potential to advance
the field in these areas. We seek a candidate with evidence of
inclusive teaching practices who can work with undergraduate and
graduate students from diverse academic and sociocultural
backgrounds. The successful candidate will engage in service at the
program, department and campus wide levels, with particular focus
on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion service, including recruiting
more diverse faculty. We welcome candidates who understand the
barriers facing women and minorities who are underrepresented in
higher education careers (as evidenced by life experiences and
educational background), and who have experience in diversity,
equity, and inclusion with respect to teaching, mentoring,
research, life experiences, or service towards building an
equitable and diverse scholarly environment.

In addition to encouraging participation in robust departmental,
divisional, and campus mentoring, the campus offers a Faculty
Community Networking Program (https://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu/faculty-community-networking-program/index.html).
UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian
American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution
with a high proportion of first-in-family undergraduate
students.

The Arts Division supports faculty research through the Arts
Research Institute http://artsresearch.ucsc.edu/ari/; the campus
supports research and teaching with grants awarded by the Committee
on Research, the Committee on Teaching, and other groups.

This recruitment is supported by the UC Office of the President’s
Advancing Faculty Diversity program and includes enhanced funding
for faculty projects that contribute to diversity and to creating
an inclusive climate.

Responsibilities:

● Teach 4 courses over each 3-quarter academic year
● Mentor and advise undergraduate and graduate students, including
overseeing independent projects/research
● Maintain a professional practice as research. UC Santa Cruz is a
Research 1 University and a nationally recognized profile of
creative research is required for tenure and promotion. Academic
publication is not standard for promotion in the department, but
many faculty produce both creative and scholarly research
nationally and internationally.
● Contribute service to the department, Arts Division, and
university at large, with a particular emphasis on building an
equitable and diverse scholarly environment.
● Service to the community and research in service of communities.
We acknowledge that research and public-facing creative activity
overlapping with service are fully valued as research.

Given our department’s focus on decolonial approaches to teaching,
research, and service, our first round of review will be solely
based on (1) the statement of creative practice and research and
(2) the statement of contributions to diversity, equity and
inclusion. We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing
historically oppressed groups in higher education, and who have
engaged in teaching, research, professional and/or public service
contributions that promote equity, justice, and antiracist,
decolonial practice. We are looking for candidates that demonstrate
effective strategies that support the recruitment and success of
underrepresented scholars and students, which may take a variety of
forms. The rubric that we will use to evaluate the statement of
contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion is available here:
https://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/communications/docs/UCSCRubricsC2DEIStatements.pdf

Applicants from historically underrepresented groups are especially
encouraged to apply.

Richard E. and Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow
Position in Environmental Engineering at Bucknell
University

Job No: 497181
Position Type: full-time
Location: Lewisburg, PA
Categories: Civil & Environmental Engineering

The Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department at
Bucknell University invites applications for a Richard E. and
Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow position in
Environmental Engineering, starting in August 2023. The Smith PTT
Fellowship Program promotes pedagogical and institutional
excellence through diversification of faculty and curricula at the
University. Richard and Yvonne Smith were people of great
intellectual curiosity and humility, with uplifting and encouraging
spirits and a generous hospitality that was a foundation for
promoting inclusion and belonging at Bucknell. They reached out to
and engaged with students and colleagues in ways that left a
profound and positive impact on the institution. In that spirit, we
are seeking candidates from diverse backgrounds who have an active
intellectual life that they wish to share with the Bucknell
community. Candidates from groups underrepresented among faculty in
higher education are strongly encouraged to apply, and we hope that
you will. It would be a privilege to learn more about you, and we
would like for you to get to know us as well!

The CEE Department at Bucknell offers B.S. and M.S. degree programs
in civil engineering (CENG) and environmental engineering (EVEG).
The Department's mission is to prepare the next generation of
leaders in the stewardship of our natural and built environments,
for the benefit of the planet, communities, and people. The
hallmarks of a Bucknell CEE education include outstanding teaching,
small class sizes, hands-on and experiential learning, close
interaction with approachable faculty and staff, and opportunities
for undergraduates to conduct research with faculty. In addition,
through this advertised position and other efforts, the Department
is striving to create an inclusive and supportive community in
which all voices are valued and respected, diverse perspectives are
embraced, and students, faculty, and staff of all backgrounds and
identities can thrive.

For this position, we seek individuals with broad teaching and
scholarly interests in the area of environmental engineering and
who wish to cultivate and develop these interests with support and
mentoring. Candidates must have a doctorate in environmental
engineering, or a closely related engineering field, at the time of
appointment. Candidates are asked to convey in their application
materials an enthusiasm for undergraduate teaching, a commitment to
inclusive teaching practices in the classroom and laboratory, and
an interest in establishing a productive research program. We are
seeking an individual with teaching interests to support the EVEG
curriculum, as well as scholarly interests that complement our
current capabilities. This position is ideal for candidates who are
excited about working to enhance established strengths of the
University, examples of which include research involving
undergraduates, collaboration within and across departments and
colleges, community engagement, and others.

The successful candidate will spend one or two years as a Smith PTT
Fellow at Bucknell, bringing new perspectives and contemporary
knowledge and participating in campus life. The Fellow will receive
mentoring, a reduced teaching load, resources for scholarship,
travel, and professional development, and other support that will
help them a) better understand the nature of a career as a
teacher-scholar at a predominantly undergraduate institution; b)
develop and strengthen their pedagogical skills and experience; and
c) establish and enhance their research trajectory. The Fellow will
have the opportunity to engage in innovative teaching and
scholarship within our excellent facilities, including the
University's Environmental Engineering and Science Laboratory
(EESL). At the end of the fellowship period, and with positive
evaluations, the Fellow will transition into a tenure-track faculty
position at Bucknell.

Application materials must include the following five documents: 1)
a cover letter that clearly summarizes the candidate's interest in
Bucknell and in this position; 2) a current curriculum vitae; 3) a
teaching statement that conveys the candidate's interest in
undergraduate teaching, describes the candidate's ideas or
philosophy for equitable and inclusive teaching, and identifies the
courses within the EVEG curriculum to which the candidate could
contribute (3 pages maximum); 4) a scholarship statement addressing
the candidate's plans for scholarly work at Bucknell and how that
work may include undergraduates, if applicable (2 pages maximum);
and 5) contact information for at least three potential references
(letters may be requested by the search committee). Applications
will only be accepted online through Bucknell's career site
(careers.bucknell.edu). Applications will be reviewed beginning on
November 1, 2022, and will continue until the position is
filled.

learning a graduation requirement. CSUMB's service learning
requirement is deeply grounded in learning outcomes related to
diversity, equity and social justice; and is integrated into both
the General Education program (Lower Division Civics/Service
Learning), and the graduation requirements of each major (Upper
Division Service Learning). Each academic year, approximately 40%
of CSUMB students enroll in one of over 130 service learning
courses, and contribute over 100,000 hours to 300+ schools,
non-profit organizations and governmental agencies in the Monterey
Bay (Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties) and Salinas
Valley region.

The Service Learning Institute is both the academic and
administrative support home for service learning at CSUMB. SLI
offers service learning courses to meet both the lower and upper
division service learning requirement, supports a dynamic Student
Leadership in Service Learning Program, and is home to the Minor in
Social Justice and Community Leadership. The SLI is also
responsible for providing support for the delivery of high quality,
social justice-oriented service learning courses for all CSUMB
students campus-wide. This includes supporting the creation of
community partnerships, managing risk and safety issues, and
facilitating overall program evaluation.

The Service Learning Institute is seeking an experienced,
innovative, collaborative leader to serve as Director and
Department Chair, and to guide the Service Learning Institute into
its next phase of development and growth. After 25 years, we seek
to build on our successes, develop the reciprocity of our
university and community partnerships, deepen collaboration with
CSUMB's Ethnic and Gender Studies courses and participatory action
research programs. We seek a leader who can implement strategies
that provide opportunities for our Black, Indigenous and people of
color (BIPOC) students to engage in community action that is
informed by the rich cultural and historic traditions of social
activism located in our regional communities. Our next Director
will have the communication skills to inspire enthusiasm for
service learning and community engagement, the ability to support
scholarship and relationship building with diverse cultural
communities, and the capacity to build a collaborative and
effective team. Our goal as a community-engaged university is to
graduate students who have the skills, attitudes, and passions to
become multicultural community builders and social change agents
who are prepared to meet future community challenges. Our new
Director will play a central role in this endeavor.

The Director of the Service Learning Institute reports directly to
the Dean of the University College.

Position Description


The Department of Performance, Play & Design (PPD) (formerly
Theater Arts Department) at the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant
Professor of Dance. We have a strong interest in a dance
professional whose research is informed by a demonstrated history
of embodied practice and critical inquiry, with a preference for
experimental choreographers steeped in dance practices that have
historically been marginalized by Western concert dance (e.g., hip
hop or salsa). The successful candidate will teach technique,
choreography, and repertory courses in our dance curriculum and
specialized courses in their expertise such as: Indigenous dance;
dances of the African diaspora, Pacific Rim, or Latin America;
dance and disability; digital performance; screen-dance;
performance as social practice; critical dance and race studies,
etc. We have a strong preference for candidates with expertise in
performance as community-led social change, antiracist theory and
decolonial performance practice, and working across both digital
and live platforms, and University and/or professional dance
teaching experience and demonstrated service to the field.

Possible related areas of interest might include ensemble work,
site-specific performance, consent-based performance/theatrical
intimacy practices, and/or digital performance (VR, AR, MR, XR,
interactive, motion capture). Because we are committed to equitable
practices with regards to race, class, gender, sexuality,
neurodiversity, ability, and religion, we are particularly
interested in scholar-practitioners who have demonstrated potential
to lead the field in these areas. We seek a candidate with evidence
of inclusive teaching practices who can work with undergraduate and
graduate students from diverse academic and sociocultural
backgrounds. The successful candidate will engage in service at the
program, department and campus wide levels, with particular focus
on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion service, including recruiting
more diverse faculty. We welcome candidates who understand the
barriers facing women and minorities who are underrepresented in
higher education careers (as evidenced by life experiences and
educational background), and who have experience in diversity,
equity, and inclusion with respect to teaching, mentoring,
research, life experiences, or service towards building an
equitable and diverse scholarly environment.

Previously a Theater Arts department (Design, Acting, Directing,
Dance, Playwriting, History/Theory/Dramaturgy), we have recently
merged with the Art & Design: Games and Playable Media program.
The Department, comprising 17 nationally and internationally
recognized faculty members, is positioned at the intersection of
storytelling, worldbuilding, and cross-platform, interdisciplinary
collaborations. Our curriculum centers anti-racist, intersectional
feminist, and decolonial approaches. We offer two BA degrees, a
Dance Minor, and a MA degree that emphasize creative collaboration,
risk-taking/experimentation, critical/systemic thinking, rigor,
agency, embodiment, and practice-as-research proficiencies. The
Department also intersects with the MFA Digital Arts and New Media
program. For more on our department and our social justice
statement, please visit: https://theater.ucsc.edu/programs/about-department
and please see https://arts.ucsc.edu/page/arts-division-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-statement.

divisional, and campus mentoring, the campus offers a Faculty
Community Networking Program. UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving

Position Description


The History of Art and Visual Culture Department (HAVC,
havc.ucsc.edu) at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)
invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor of
Asia-Pacific Visual Cultures. The position centers on the
Asia-Pacific region, defined as the western Pacific Ocean,
including Southeast Asia (inclusive of Taiwan and Hong Kong),
Oceania (Australia and the Pacific Islands), the Philippines, South
Asia, and/or East Asia (China, Japan, and Korea). The HAVC
Department seeks a scholar whose historical and/or
historically-informed research focuses on visual and/or material
cultures of this region. We are interested in a colleague whose
research and teaching pursue decolonial approaches to art and
visual culture practices and consider these in relation to colonial
cultures of racialization that entail incarceration, enslavement,
genocide, or forced migration, as well as the suppression of social
identities (such as those related to gender, sexuality, genealogy,
and class). We also welcome applications from scholars who address
the socio-environmental aspects of colonial modernity in the
Asia-Pacific region from critical and regionally-specific
perspectives. This position addresses these issues by advancing
local perspectives and voices in a range of historical contexts.
The successful candidate will teach and advise graduate students in
the Visual Studies Ph.D. program and major and non-major
undergraduate students in the HAVC B.A. program. We also value a
colleague who contributes to transforming the culture of higher
education institutions through their publicly-engaged research that
is deeply embedded in and attentive to the communities that they
serve.

The HAVC faculty affirms its commitment to recognizing, addressing,
and combatting all forms of discrimination, including
discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender,
sexuality, and ability. The department collectively seeks to
empower students, colleagues, and our campus community toward the
goal of creating an inclusive, respectful, and equitable
environment. We recognize that the above types of discrimination
and resulting oppression are not limited to the U.S. These are
global challenges that impact a broad range of constituencies.
Therefore, as a department, we share an ethical obligation to
create an environment that addresses the unique forms of bias that
affect our diverse community. Please see HAVC’s Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion Statement: https://arts.ucsc.edu/page/arts-division-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-statement

We have a strong undergraduate major; an undergraduate
concentration in Curation, Heritage, and Museums; and a dynamic
Visual Studies Ph.D. program. HAVC faculty support the
investigation of art and visual culture from a variety of
historical and theoretical perspectives in the cultures of Africa,
the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific
Islands. The HAVC Department is in the Division of the Arts, which
also includes departments of Art; Film and Digital Media; Music;
Performance, Play & Design; and the M.F.A. Program in Digital
Arts & New Media. There are opportunities for scholarly and
teaching connections in these areas, as well as with colleagues and
programs across the campus. The campus operates on a schedule of
three 11-week quarters per academic year. In accordance with the
department’s workload policy, faculty members are required to offer
the equivalent of 5 five-unit courses per year (which normally
means teaching 4 courses over three quarters and carrying out other
academic and service responsibilities); effectively advise and
mentor undergraduate and graduate students; actively engage in
research; and undertake administrative service for the department,
affiliated college, campus, and university. The ability to
contribute significantly to graduate education and the mentoring of
graduate students is highly desirable.

Our first round of review will be based solely on (1) the letter of
application and (2) the statement of contributions to diversity,
equity and inclusion. We welcome candidates who understand the
barriers facing historically oppressed and underrepresented groups
in higher education careers and who have experience in equity and
diversity with respect to teaching, mentoring, research, life
experiences, or service towards building an equitable and diverse
scholarly environment. This recruitment is supported by the UC
Office of the President’s Advancing Faculty Diversity program and
includes enhanced funding for faculty projects that contribute to
diversity and to creating an inclusive climate.

Our division is enjoying faculty growth, significant fundraising
successes, research centers, and innovative programming through the
Institute of the Arts and Sciences and the Mary Porter Sesnon
Gallery. The Arts Division supports faculty research through the
Arts Research Institute. The campus supports research and teaching
with grants awarded by the Committee on Research, the Committee on
Teaching, and other groups.

UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian
American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution
with a high proportion of first-in-family undergraduate students.
In addition to encouraging participation in robust departmental,
divisional, and campus mentoring, the campus offers a Faculty
Community Networking Program that provides support for
African-American/Black/Caribbean, Asian-American/Pacific Islander,

Position Description


The Computational Media department (https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media)
at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites
applications up to an Associate Teaching Professor for Capstone and
Experiential Learning. Candidates should be experienced in the
conceptualization, design, development, and critique of
interactive, playable forms of computational media. This could
include one or more of: video games, interactive narratives,
immersive performances, virtual reality environments, alternate
reality games, playable installations, and/or many other types of
creative, expressive work.

We are open to candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds. We
value academic research experience, industry and non-profit
development experience, arts/design/performance experience, and
more. While this is not a position focused on teaching
frameworks/engines or programming (which are covered elsewhere in
the curriculum) an understanding of processes and tools used to
create computational media work is desired.

The successful candidate will develop and teach courses within the
graduate and undergraduate curriculum; continue their work in
creative, technical, and/or scholarly practices of computational
media; and participate in shaping our diverse, interdisciplinary
department. Pedagogical scholarship and participation in
departmental and school-wide teaching and learning initiatives also
form an important aspect of the position. The teaching for this
position is expected to include courses in the capstone sequence
for the department’s undergraduate degree, courses in the capstone
sequence for the professional MS in Games and Playable Media, and
undergraduate and graduate elective courses in the faculty member’s
area(s) of specialty. This faculty member’s computational media
scholarly activity and practice will be supported in the same
manner as other faculty, with facilities, equipment, internal
funding, support in seeking external funding, and other resources
available. Service expectations include participating in
departmental committees, eventually taking on departmental
leadership roles, and optionally developing new departmental
initiatives, work at the School of Engineering level, and/or
Academic Senate positions at the campus and system-wide levels.
Many of our faculty work with non-profit organizations, government
bodies, and/or industry. This kind of work can be pursued in
integration with a faculty member’s university research scholarly
activity and/or as an independent individual.

Beyond experience with creating and critiquing playable forms of
computational media, we are interested in candidates who engage a
wide variety of other areas of professional achievement and
activity and creative practice. For example, any of these: critical
media making, game writing, game artificial intelligence, software
and/or platform studies, novel interface technologies, agent
architectures for interactive characters, interactive sound,
real-time computer graphics, games user experience, efficacy
evaluation, story customization and/or generation approaches,
augmented reality, procedural content generation, modeling and
animation, game software engineering, history and interpretation of
computational media, tabletop games, game analytics and
visualization, natural language generation and dialog systems for
interactive characters, automated analysis and “distant reading” of
computational media, and/or another computational media
approach.

The working titles of this position are Associate Teaching
Professor or Assistant Teaching Professor, while the payroll titles
are part of the Security of Employment title series. These titles
are used differently at the University of California than at some
other institutions. Important facts to note are: An Associate
Teaching Professor is analogous to tenure and an Assistant Teaching
Professor is eligible for promotion to an Associate Teaching
Professor. This position confers membership in the Academic Senate,
earns sabbatical credit, provides summer flexibility and a full
vote in departmental decision-making, including voting on all
academic personnel cases. The candidate hired for this position
will have Principal Investigator status for the purpose of grant
applications and administration. The successful candidate, as with
all faculty, will be regularly reviewed for further advancement and
salary increases, using criteria set by the University of
California system. The main difference between this and Professor
Series titles is additional teaching (expected course load
equivalent to six quarter-long courses per year, with additional
course release as appropriate for University services rendered
above the normal expectations) along with scholarship and
leadership in the implementation and development of innovative
pedagogical practices to support a diverse student body. The
successful candidate will join a sizable cadre of teaching
professors in the School of Engineering, all committed to teaching
excellence and innovation.

UC Santa Cruz values diversity, equity, and inclusion and is
committed to hiring faculty who will work to advance these values.
To be considered, candidates must clearly articulate an
understanding of the barriers facing women, people of color, and
other groups underrepresented in engineering, as well as describe
their experience and future plans to promote equity and inclusion
in teaching, mentoring, professional and scholarly activity.
Efforts supporting equity and inclusion at UC Santa Cruz will be
recognized as important during the merit review and promotion
process.

UC Santa Cruz is a Minority-serving Institution (MSI) with a high
proportion of first-in-family students. UC Santa Cruz is a member
of the Association of American Universities (AAU, an association of
the top research universities in the US), a Hispanic-Serving
Institution (HSI), a member of the Alliance of Hispanic-Serving
Research Universities (HRSU), a member of the Computing Alliance of
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), an Asian American and Native
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), and a
member of several identity and ethnic affinity professional
societies. Broadening participation in engineering, and equitably
and inclusively serving underrepresented minoritized students, are
key values at UC Santa Cruz.

The Computational Media Department is dedicated to the creation,
enhancement, and study of media forms where computational processes
enable deeply interactive and generative experiences. As a
pioneering department, we are looking for new faculty who are
excited to help us define and grow this emerging area. The
department emphasizes the construction of technologies that make
possible novel media experiences, while simultaneously embracing
and engaging in theoretical and practical approaches from the arts,
humanities, and social sciences. (Our faculty have exhibited
artworks internationally, published monographs with leading
presses, released widely-played games and influential software, and
received a variety of awards from computing, social science,
humanities, and arts bodies.) The department offers a BS in
Computer Game Design and an MS and PhD in Computational Media at
the Santa Cruz campus. In addition, it offers professional MS
programs in Games and Playable Media, Serious Games, and
Human-Computer Interaction at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus in
Santa Clara, California. The Computational Media Department is
located within the Baskin School of Engineering. The successful
applicant will typically spend multiple days per week in Santa Cruz
and is also expected to spend on average one day per week on the
Santa Clara campus (more when teaching a class on the Santa Clara
campus). The ability for on-demand transportation between Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz with or without accommodations is
essential.

Our campus is the nearest University of California campus to
Silicon Valley and has close research ties with the local computer
industry. Nestled in a redwood forest above the city of Santa Cruz,
our beautiful campus has a long history of embracing groundbreaking
interdisciplinary work. Our proximity to Silicon Valley, and our
satellite campus there, afford opportunities and avenues for
collaboration with researchers working in the many research and
development labs in Silicon Valley, as well as with the other San
Francisco Bay Area universities.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

Department of Liberal Studies: Liberal Studies (LS) is one of two undergraduate departments in the College of Education and Integrative Studies (CEIS). The department hosts three elementary education preparation degrees (pre-credential, ITEP mild/moderate, and ITEP moderate/severe), and a general studies program adapted to serve students interested in a variety of subject areas that prepare them for graduate school and careers in fields like social work, counseling, law, health, and many others. Recently, the LS department merged with the Interdisciplinary General Education (IGE) program––a student-centered, discussion, cohort-based program––that offers an alternative option to the traditional GE pathway to expand students’ college and intellectual experience through an interdisciplinary approach. The LS department also possesses a robust service-learning curriculum that supports an experience-based education through community partnerships with organizations like Pomona Unified School District, the Pomona Community Farmers Alliance, the dA Center for the Arts, and The Learning Connection. No matter the specific learning track they choose, LS majors experience a liberal arts education in a learn-by-doing environment that centers on practices of creativity, social justice and responsibility, sustainability, and wellness—the program’s four organizing themes. 
In alignment with the CEIS Mission, Values, and Vision, the LS department recognizes the historical, systemic, and present conditions that marginalize our communities through intersecting forms of oppression across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, language, culture, class, religion, nationality, immigration and documentation status, and disability. The LS department welcomes all students and recognizes the tremendous value that all our differences contribute to an intellectual scholarly environment. Cal Poly Pomona is a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution and a designated Asian American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, and our students are enriched by a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Our students reflect the shifting demographics of higher education, and include parents, immigrants, first-generation, transfer, disabled and differently-abled students from a variety of identities and backgrounds.
We are committed to cultivating a learning environment that engages critical thinking and creative practice to identify and disrupt these formations the historical, systemic, and present formations of oppression that marginalize our communities. We are a highly collaborative collection of multidisciplinary faculty - with expertise stemming from a wide range of scholarly communities from environmental and food sciences to the fine arts and humanities and that serves a student body that is 66 percent, underrepresented minority students, many women of color, and first-generation college students. We value liberal arts education, which is exceedingly beneficial for students from historically marginalized communities, as a social, intellectual, and communal experience to transform students’ lives, communities, and workplaces to create whole persons that can form inclusive and equitable environments.
We are re-designing the program to challenge boundaries of discipline, nation, and identity through implementing critical, intersectional, antiracist, decolonial pedagogies, and transdisciplinary approaches, linguistically and culturally responsive engagement, and the advancement of social justice and equity to prepare students for a vastly more global and collaborative future that must address pressing and emerging issues. Moreover, as a liberal arts-based program at a polytechnic university that values community engagement, we continue to lead the campus in service-learning curricula and community engagement through partnerships with schools and afterschool programs that provide students opportunities to apply interdisciplinary studies in science and environmental education in areas most needed for Pomona’s historically marginalized residents. Our rich curricula and co-curricular programs prepare students to pursue graduate school and careers in teaching, social work, counseling, law, human services, health and medicine, and a wide range of other fields. We are pleased to introduce a few of our amazing students, faculty, and staff on our newly developed website.

Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The University of Texas at Austin, College of Education, is
recruiting a cluster of three Tenure-Track assistant professors to
work with our world-class community of scholars to address research
and academic programs focused on reducing education and/or health
disparities among Latino/a children, families, and
communities.

Latinos have quickly become the largest racial/ethnic minority
subgroup in the U.S. The growth among Latino populations has led to
increased cultural pluralism and demographic shifts throughout the
country, including in Texas, where more than 40% of all state
residents and where 53% of K12 student population identify as
Latina/o. The growth of the Latina/o population also underscores
the many sources of variability within the community in terms of
language, nativity, place of origin, generational history, and
socio-historical context which contribute to health and wellbeing
of children, adults, and families.

The College of Education promotes the shared values of equity,
excellence, innovation, empowerment, community-focus, and endeavors
to bridge research and practice. We view inclusiveness and
excellence as interconnected in the work of our faculty. The
College of Education is particularly interested in and values
candidates who have experience working with diverse and underserved
populations and address the interactions among our diverse
identities. Candidates should show a demonstrated commitment or
future potential to improving access and conditions in community,
school, and other settings for children, adults, families, schools,
and communities.

Successful candidates for the three tenure-track, assistant
professor positions within this cluster hire program will join
senior faculty colleagues who are identifying sources of systemic
inequities and leveraging culturally specific assets and strengths
to combat education and health disparities that impact Latina/o
communities in Texas, across the U.S., and in international
contexts throughout Latin America. The hires will be positioned in
one of three academic departments in the college, and will
contribute to the college's bold strategic vision to reimagine
education through interdisciplinary research and teaching, and deep
collaboration with communities.

We have had considerable success placing students in high-quality, allied social science graduate programs, and in prominent law schools. Faculty in the department are committed to the teacher-scholar model, which involves teaching within a traditional liberal arts environment where the primary focus is extensive interaction with undergraduate students in a small class environment, while also maintaining an active research agenda.

Stetson’s College of Arts and Sciences (http://www.stetson.edu/portal/artsci/) is the largest and most diverse of the University’s colleges and schools; it includes the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, and creative arts. With nineteen academic departments and eight interdisciplinary programs, the College is the liberal arts core of the University. A great strength of the College is its faculty of approximately 140 full-time teacher-scholars. The College offers 31 undergraduate majors and 34 undergraduate minors; six graduate degrees are offered in Education, Counselor Education, and Creative Writing. Every undergraduate major requires a senior research project, giving students the opportunity to design and carry out independent research under faculty mentorship. Our academic programs are shaped by the values of social justice and civic responsibility. All of our courses and programs of study promote engaged learning, whereby students create connections between the classroom or lab and the local, regional, and global community. The academic programs of the College of Arts and Sciences prepare students to live significant lives, to interact with and positively affect the world around them.

Graduate programs offered include Business, Accounting, Educational Leadership, Counseling, and Creative Writing. Florida’s oldest private institution of higher learning, Stetson has regularly been ranked among the best regional universities in the Southeast and was the first private college in Florida to be granted a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

THE NESS SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS:
The Ness School, in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, includes approximately 30 full-time faculty members and a team of undergraduate academic advisors. The school embodies an intellectual philosophy that economics and quantitative analysis are foundational to thriving in and critically assessing a modern global economy; students who major in business economics, entrepreneurial studies, or agricultural business complete a comprehensive suite of business courses, including those in our 42-credit management and economics core.
The Ness School of Management and Economics offers students a high-quality education and excellent job-placement opportunities. Graduates hold leadership and management positions across the northern Great Plains, Midwest, and nationally in banking and finance, processing and manufacturing management, energy and bioenergy, and food and agribusiness management, and in policy, oversight, and regulation; and many are leaders in the broader innovation and entrepreneurship community.
The Ness School is in the process of securing AACSB accreditation, managing significant enrollment growth in its majors, and balancing new opportunities in core business fields—including enterprise management and innovation—with its traditional strengths in economics and quantitative analysis. The school embraces interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration in research, teaching, community engagement, and extension work—in some cases, formally, for the school’s faculty members who hold SDSU Extension appointments. The school enrolls approximately 800 undergraduate majors, including more than 500 students who major in business economics and more than 200 students who major in agricultural business, a degree conferred by the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental Sciences. The school also offers an undergraduate degree in economics, which includes upper-level coursework in mathematical economics, econometrics, and field areas in, for example, international economics, environmental and resource economics, public policy, and agricultural policy.
Additionally, the school offers a master’s degree in economics that includes two program options: an economic-theory option that requires courses in advanced microeconomics, advanced macroeconomics, econometrics, and research methods, emphasizing applied economic research in the form of graduate thesis; and a business-economics option that requires courses in managerial economics, advanced business decision science, financial management, marketing strategy and analytics, and a capstone experience that blends corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and marketing analytics and potentially collaborates with industry.
The Ness School operates within a rich and supportive corporate-enterprise ecosystem. For example, Brookings is home to Daktronics (DAKT; NASDAQ), 3M (MMM; NYSE), and Larson Manufacturing (Fortune Brands, FBHS; NYSE). Meanwhile, Sioux Falls, a 45-minute drive south of Brookings, is home to several thriving corporate enterprises with which SDSU enjoys productive relationships. Additionally, Innovation Partners and the Enterprise Institute located at the SDSU Research Park Innovation Center in Brookings provide opportunities for networking with regional innovators and entrepreneurs, as well as opportunities for part-time employment and incubator space for students. SDSU enjoys a strong investor and alumni network in the corporate space that is actively engaged in the classroom and in student ventures.
Moreover, the Ness School enjoys generous philanthropic support for faculty development in the form of endowed chairs, professorships, and faculty-scholar appointments.

The candidate should have a 5-year research plan that could be supported by external funding and would provide opportunities for involvement by undergraduates, preferably in laboratory or field work. Research areas of particular interest include oceanography/marine science, soil science, or atmospheric science. Areas of teaching need include a lower-division lab course entitled Introduction to Earth Systems; an upper division course in Climate Science; contributions to a departmental research skills course (e.g., statistics, GIS, or senior capstone); and possibly other courses related to the candidate's specialty. The department is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, and encourages applications from members of historically excluded groups, including people of color, women, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities. For more information about our programs and faculty see https://www.scu.edu/cas/ess/.  
To apply, please include: (1) curriculum vitae; (2) summaries of teaching evaluations and sample syllabi; (3) a representative example of your published or in-progress scholarship, (4) a letter of interest that articulates your teaching experience and philosophy, your five-year plan for your research, and your potential to foster intra- and interdepartmental connections at Santa Clara; and (5) a statement articulating how your hire would advance Santa Clara's ability to provide a diverse and inclusive learning environment.

Located in the heart of northern California’s Silicon Valley, Santa Clara is a private, Catholic Jesuit university committed to promoting social justice in a comprehensive educational setting. It is an AA/EOE employer. Faculty are teaching-scholars who balance a commitment to quality teaching with active, externally funded programs of research. A full-time teaching load is 7 courses per year on a quarter system, with a 1-course reduction for research. Because courses with lab sections count as 2 courses, most science faculty teach one lecture+lab course each quarter to fulfill their teaching load, and faculty occasionally obtain course releases via extramural funding. Housing assistance is available. This position is contingent upon the availability of funding.
