Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences
Chair and
Director
 
The past year has magnified the ways that inequities—whether due
to race, gender, sexuality, or income—contribute to health
disparities. These inequities are a major public health threat and
demand a concerted, interdisciplinary effort. At the College of
Public Health, we dedicate ourselves to public health in all its
parameters, from epidemiology to nursing, from social work to
rehabilitation sciences. Social justice has always driven our work,
understanding that individual outcomes are intricately tied to the
larger systems we inhabit, is the foundation of our college.
 
The Temple University College of Public Health’s
interprofessional culture fosters collaboration both within and
outside the College.  We value differences among our faculty
and believe that we can better serve and understand our
Philadelphia community and beyond through the diversity of our
individual faculty and our disciplines. Join us in our mission to
develop progressive, compassionate researchers, practitioners, and
clinicians to build a better tomorrow, grounded in creating the
environments and health infrastructure that will make us the
healthiest nation.
 
The Position and Qualifications. Temple
University College of Public Health announces a national search for
the Chair and Director of the Department of Health and

Health and Rehabilitation Sciences education and research. Located
within a novel population health and prevention paradigm, the
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Department is a key component
within the College that brings together disciplines focused on

professionalism and commitment to diversity and inclusion in all
its forms. The position’s incumbent will have the opportunity to

who can strengthen IPE opportunities between its graduate programs
in physical therapy, occupational therapy, athletic training, and
recreational therapy. The department also includes a large
undergraduate program in health professions that has multiple
opportunities for expansion and development.

Therapy, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Doctor of Philosophy in
Neuromotor Science, Bachelor of Science in Health Professions, and
other undergraduate and graduate programs.   The

public health, nursing, social work, and communication sciences

TISCH SCHOOL CLUSTER HIRE INITIATIVE
 
Matters of representation lie at the center of research and
practice in the arts today.  The question of how to stand for,
speak for, and depict the lives and beliefs of oneself and others
is a pressing concern in the arts education curriculum. Who gets
represented? Who creates the representations?  Who gets left
out and why? Who or what controls this depiction? What does it mean
to be unrepresented? (Or overrepresented, for that matter) How does
political representation align, or not, with representational
diversity in culture?
 
These questions unify disparate areas of creative work, from
dance to documentary. They also span multiple fields of scholarly
practice. The proposed faculty hiring cluster is an innovative
partnership among departments within Tisch School of the Arts, and
will create a nexus of practice-led research within the School. It
seeks out scholars and practitioners whose work analyzes
intersections of race, gender, and identity, and shifts perception
through innovative strategies of representation.

digital profiling); technology policy, law, and race; Black digital
aesthetics; digital archiving and representation and interpretation

representations of gendered  and racial
minorities; knowledge production and ownership of archival
records; integrity and user acceptance of digital
archives;  AI; algorithmic bias, learning, and information
organization; Black and indigenous archive and preservation

Position Announcement
The Department of Art at the University of Oregon is accepting
applications for a tenure-track faculty position in photography at
the rank of Assistant Professor with a start date of September 16,
2022. The position is a full-time, nine-month academic year
appointment.

We seek a faculty member whose creative research locates the medium
of photography firmly within the context of contemporary art and
interdisciplinarity, while finding its footing in a lens-based
practice. With an aptitude in both digital technologies and
traditional analog methods, the ideal candidate for this position
will also have fluency in contemporary cultural and aesthetic
theory, with an interest in course development in this area.

The successful candidate will have the ability to work effectively
with faculty, staff, and students from a variety of diverse
backgrounds and media areas. An MFA, or equivalent terminal degree
is required. A minimum of three years college teaching experience
beyond graduate school is preferred. The candidate should have a
strong and active exhibition/publication record.

Some potential areas of research interest for the ideal candidate
are:

Artists with a clear interdisciplinary and installation-related
approach to the medium whose practice draws from the cultural and
aesthetic potency of photography's indexical relationship to the
visible world, either through lens-based original capture or
archival appropriation.

Artists with a lens-based approach to the medium whose practice
taps into the directed/performative potential of photography, while
engaging larger questions of identity, race and/or gender.

Artists with a “documentary” approach to the medium whose
practice expands on how this generic term is understood and
engaged, either through a deep theoretical investment in
documentary practices, or by bridging their production to other
forms, such as performance and video, or working with photographic
archives to locate and amplify the cultural signs and symbols
embedded in every photographic image.

Primary teaching responsibilities will be focused in the
photography area, with additional interdisciplinary opportunities,
including graduate seminars, advanced studios and experimental
courses. The University of Oregon operates on a system of three
10-week quarters with a typical load of five courses per year.
Additionally, all faculty participate in graduate studio
mentorship. Service responsibilities include committee
contributions, advising, and participation in shared governance. In
addition to teaching and service responsibilities, the successful
candidate will be expected to demonstrate a commitment to a
sustained and developing creative practice, with an active and
ongoing exhibition/publishing record.

Entering faculty generally will not supervise student employees
(undergraduate and graduate), adjunct faculty, or classified staff,
but may do so once tenure is granted.

Department or Program Summary
Situated within a nationally recognized research institution, the
Department of Art attracts students and faculty who value the study
of studio art in the context of a larger intellectual and critical
environment. Our curriculum reflects a diverse and fluid set of
creative practices and critical methodologies. Students engage
broad and interdisciplinary approaches, as well as depth within
specific media area practices. A robust visiting lecture series,
bringing 10-12 artists, critics and curators to campus each year,
complements the curriculum. Nationally and internationally active,
the faculty thrive on making connections between their individual
studio practices and teaching. While we have diverse backgrounds,
philosophies and approaches, we have a strong commitment to a
collective mission and a shared governance model.

The Department of Art is one of the two departments within the
School of Art + Design within the College of Design, which also

ceramics, art & technology (print media, animation, video and
interactivity), fibers, jewelry and metals, painting and drawing,
photography, printmaking, and sculpture. The Department includes 21
tenure-track faculty and 12 Career Instructors.

The photography area is one of eight media areas in the Department
of Art. The area currently has one Tenure Track and two Non-Tenure
Track faculty. Classes in the photography area emphasize conceptual
and contextual engagement with the medium and offer instruction in
analog and digital methods of image making. The area offers a
breadth of courses driven by both concept and process to emphasize
the wide range of possibilities within the medium. Our course
offerings interweave contemporary critical theory alongside the
history of photography in a comprehensive curriculum that develops
students' artistic practice, critical thinking and writing
skills.

Faculty and students working in the photography area have access to
a range of spaces and equipment to support the development of
creative research, including: a lighting studio, digital output
workspaces equipped with large format Epson printers, darkrooms

create a community built on respect, equity, collaboration, and
empathy. We recognize that equity is essential to the existence and
prolificacy of dance, and critical to the creation of a more just
and inclusive dance field. By striving to promote an environment
welcoming to people of all cultures, races, sexes, abilities,
sexual orientations, gender identities and/or expressions, ages,
religions, and economic statuses, we believe creativity, critical
thinking, and self-expression can thrive. To that end, we are
launching a revised BA degree in 2022 that brings African and
African Diasporic dance into more equal partnership with Western
concert dance in our curriculum. In addition, we are continuing to
re-envision our department through diversity, equity, inclusion,

curriculum, faculty expertise, and concert programming.

related to race, colonization, and power; dance making; dance
histories; or embodied rhythms. Candidates will have the

Additional responsibilities include student mentoring,
department service, participation on MFA supervisory committees,
and other duties as assigned. Opportunities may also include
directing and/or choreographing for concerts featuring work by
faculty and guests.

31% first-generation college students, over 30% Pell Grant
students, and over 31,000 faculty and staff from more than 70
countries. The candidate is also expected to actively contribute to
the diversity, equity and inclusivity goals of the Department, as
articulated above, and in the UW Diversity Blueprint (http://www.washington.edu/diversity/diversity-blueprint/).
People who do not see themselves historically represented in
academia are encouraged to apply.

field required by start of appointment. Candidates must demonstrate
expertise in African and/or African Diasporic dances and their
cultural histories, a record of creative and/or scholarly
activities, and a minimum of one year prior experience (part-time
acceptable) teaching dance at the college or university
level. The successful candidate will have effective

The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Amherst College
invites applications for two full-time appointments specializing in
the anthropology or sociology of race, health, and the environment,
beginning on July 1, 2022. One of the positions will be a
tenure-track appointment at the rank of assistant professor. The
other will be a tenured appointment at the rank of associate or
professor. Topical areas of specialization might include, but are
not limited to the following: health and environmental justice;
racialized geographies of pollution and health; indigenous

Georgia Southern University Libraries invites applications and
nominations for the position of Head of Research Services and
Tenure-Track Associate Professor or Professor. The home campus for

Georgia Southern University is a distinctive combination of
Southern charm and uncompromising academics. We are a Carnegie
Doctoral/R2 institution serving about 26,500 students through nine
colleges on three beautiful oak-lined campuses in Statesboro,
Savannah, Hinesville, and via a growing online program. Throughout
its degree offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's, and
doctoral levels, Georgia Southern cultivates community
collaboration, world-class scholarship, and hands-on learning
opportunities.

Georgia Southern University was founded in 1906 as a school for
teaching modern agricultural production techniques and homemaking
skills to rural school children. Its Savannah campus was
established in 1935 as Armstrong Junior College for local youth who
could not afford to attend college away from home. The Liberty
Center in Hinesville was established in 1998 to serve the military
and their families at nearby Fort Stewart, the largest military
base east of the Mississippi. All three locations came together in
2018 when Armstrong State University and Georgia Southern
University consolidated. The ""new"" Georgia Southern University
preserves a passion for serving its neighbors while preparing
students for lifelong service as scholars, leaders, and responsible
stewards of their communities.
