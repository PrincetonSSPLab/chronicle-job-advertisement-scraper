Rapid, anthropogenic changes to the earth’s climate is one of the most fundamental challenges to humanity at the moment. While we are struggling to find political and technological fixes to limit the severity of climate change in the near future, we are already living on a changed planet. Humans have survived periods of rapid climate change before and current vulnerabilities as well as capacities for resilience are the cumulative result of the deep histories of human engagement with environments, locally, regionally and globally. Archaeological data can illuminate how people have responded to past climate changes, provide insight into modes of cultural and socioecological resilience of communities past and present, and supply a wide range of scenarios to consider as we plan for the future.
Community vulnerability and resilience are consequences of intersecting and often reinforcing climatic, social, political and economic structures and actions. In contexts of social and political inequality, structures of marginalization often amplify climate vulnerability with consequences for community health and wellness and social, political, or economic inequality. Research on these topics has the potential to inform contemporary issues of socio-ecological vulnerability and environmental justice. Positive factors for consideration include, but are not limited to, candidates with a record of research on past human-climate interactions that is made relevant to the challenges faced by many Black, Indigenous, or other communities.
The successful candidate will be expected to complement our existing strengths by engaging in new methods, skills, and theoretical directions in our undergraduate tracks in Indigenous Archaeology and Archaeological Science, our Masters program in archaeological heritage and our PhD program; for example, anti-racist or decolonial approaches growing out of global Black experiences, Black studies, diasporic or Africana studies, Indigenous studies, or food & climate justice.  The successful candidate will be expected to teach archaeological methods that are complementary to existing faculty.  Examples include, but are not limited to the following: data science and/or computational archaeology, faunal analysis, archaeobotany, isotopic geochemistry, materials analysis, paleogenomics, or geomorphology. The successful candidate will be expected to support the department's commitment to integrity, equity, access, and inclusion in their research, teaching, and service. The successful applicant will provide critical support for our PhD, MA and BA/BS students, and develop or expand partnerships with other efforts and centers of expertise at UW, such as those identified below.
The department of anthropology is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. In the Archaeology program, this commitment has led us to develop a unique undergraduate track in Indigenous Archaeology and to expand our long-standing investments in diversity and decolonial archaeology including community archaeology and community-based participatory research practices. Several members of the faculty have pursued decolonial and community-engaged research throughout their careers, and many of our students are deeply committed to expanding these approaches in their own work. Even so, we acknowledge the need for ongoing work to broaden and deepen these engagements, work that we are committed to advancing in the years to come.
UW Anthropology faculty engage in research, teaching, and service. Tenure-track faculty in Anthropology have an annual service period of nine months (September 16-June 15). The position is expected to begin September 16, 2023 with the start of the autumn quarter. Professional duties include maintaining an active research program, teaching, and contributing service to the Department and University. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive academic community. Members of the Department of Anthropology maintain strong connections to a variety of other units on campus including American Indian Studies, Burke Museum, Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies, Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, Center for Social Science Computation and Research, Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, Department of Global Health, eScience Institute, Indigenous Wellness Research Institute, Jackson School for International Studies, the Quaternary Research Center, Schools of Public Health and Medicine, the Science Studies Network, and the Simpson Center for the Humanities. The University of Washington serves a diverse population of 80,000 students, faculty and staff, including 34% first-generation college students and over 27% Pell Grant students. A recipient of the Alfred P. Sloan award for Faculty Career Flexibility, the UW supports career development and work-life balance for faculty.
Qualifications
Applicants must have earned a doctorate — or foreign equivalent — in anthropology/archaeology, or related field, by the date of appointment; however, applicants who have not completed their PhD at the time of application will be considered.
Application Instructions
To apply, use Interfolio  and include the following items: (1) cover letter; (2) curriculum vitae; (3) teaching statement (addressing teaching philosophy and approaches to both large lecture courses and lab/methods classes, and discussion of teaching challenges and their solutions); (4) a list of courses prepared to teach including at least one large lecture course and one method or lab class with one paragraph abstract for each; (5) research statement (explication of research activities and accomplishments as well as future plans); (6) diversity statement (statement on how your teaching, research and/or service contribute to diversity through scholarship and/or by improving access to higher education for underrepresented individuals or groups);  and (7) the names and contacts for three referees. As a guideline, we are looking for 1-2 pages (single spaced) for each of the statements on teaching, research, and diversity.

Rather than focusing upon a single medium, the Visual Studies Studio stream encourages cross-disciplinary exploration and hybrid forms of practice that can encompass painting, photography, sculpture, artists’ moving image, and other time-based media. Students in this stream gain strong visual skills, critical reasoning abilities, and an understanding of art in its historical and social contexts.

Salary and rank will be commensurate with qualifications and experience. 
Set within a preeminent research university and located at the center of one of North America’s most cosmopolitan cities, the Daniels Faculty uniquely combines the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, visual studies, and forestry in undergraduate, professional, and advanced graduate programs. The Daniels Faculty explores the intersections between nature, technology, architecture, and various built and natural geographies in a way that situates design, art, and forestry to meet their contemporary challenges. An emphasis on the connections between the various disciplines at the Faculty is apparent in the scholarly research and built work of many of our faculty. Following a decade-long transformation of the school’s faculty and professional programs, and a major increase in its endowment, the Faculty has recently expanded its undergraduate and graduate programs. To accommodate both growth in its curricular offerings and an increase in its research and outreach programs, an award-winning new building complex for the Faculty was completed on Toronto’s historic One Spadina Crescent.

Rather than focusing upon a single medium, the Visual Studies Studio stream encourages cross-disciplinary exploration and hybrid forms of practice that can encompass painting, photography, sculpture, artists’ moving image, and other time-based media. Students in this stream gain strong visual skills, critical reasoning abilities, and an understanding of art in its historical and social contexts. 
 
We are seeking a candidate with a demonstrated capacity to advance visual studies knowledge and allied disciplines in a way that can contribute meaningfully to the diverse population and intellectual milieu at the Daniels Faculty. We encourage applications from artists whose research interests and established working methodologies intersect with the varied complex and compelling creative activities of our students and their emerging critical scholarship in, but not limited to: studies of colonialism, post-colonialism, and decolonization; intersectional critiques of racialization and subjectivity; gender and sexuality studies; sustainability, the built environment, extractivism, and ecology. Please visit our home page: the John H.

requires a community-based project; these group projects encourage
inter-disciplinary approaches. All courses focus on the challenges
posed by the effects of structural racism in communities and
present students with a variety of research methodologies and
involve collaborative, interdisciplinary work. Additional
information on the college's curriculum can be found at https://eighth.ucsd.edu/.

The Director of the Eighth College Academic Program will be an
academic leader who, in addition to teaching in the program, will
contribute to its design and help define its pedagogical vision.
The director will be responsible for recruiting Senate faculty and
lecturers to teach in the program and working with them to develop
the curriculum and implement pedagogical innovations; for
supervising program staff; for monitoring and assessing the
program's effectiveness and learning outcomes; for successfully
recruiting, training and supervising teaching assistants; for

the academic program with the student life programs at the college.
The director reports to the College Provost.

Assistant/Associate/Full Professor - Sustainability, Resilience,
and Modeling

About Northeastern:
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and
the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our
world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students,
faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the
confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; Oakland; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley;
Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington
and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system.
Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:
As part of a strategic initiative, coordinated across the
university under the broad themes of Sustainability and
Resilience and Modeling, the Civil and Environmental
Engineering Department at Northeastern University seeks faculty
candidates for tenured or tenure-track appointments at the
assistant, associate, or full professor levels. For the theme of
Sustainability and Resilience, we seek candidates who are
conducting research that broadly applies and advances experimental
or computational methods to strengthen the sustainability and
resilience of urban infrastructure under current and future
stressors such as climate change, social injustice, or global
disruptions, including pandemics, war, or large natural
catastrophes. For the theme of Modeling, we seek candidates
who are applying or developing high performance computational
methods and/or artificial intelligence approaches to advance civil
infrastructure.

Appointments will be primarily in the Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering with potential for both joint
cross-department appointments in the Departments of Bioengineering,
Chemical Engineering, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, and
Electrical and Computer Engineering and joint cross-college
appointments in the College of Arts, Media and Design, the Khoury
College of Computer Sciences, the College of Science, or the
College of Social Sciences and Humanities. The University and the
College of Engineering are in the midst of a significant,
multi-year expansion in size and scope, including faculty,
facilities, and programs within several disciplines and across
disciplinary boundaries.

There are three primary areas of interest:
1. Sustainable use of embodied carbon in infrastructural
systems. This interest area involves development of a research
program designed to dramatically lower the carbon footprint of the
built urban environment. Specific topics include manufacturing or
synthesis of novel materials at infrastructure-scale, development
of innovative structural building systems for new construction
and/or redevelopment/retrofit, automation of construction methods,
use of robotics in construction and/or operations and maintenance
of infrastructure, innovative integration of architectural and
structural design with construction, advancement of additive
manufacturing processes and materials for infrastructure,
development and prototyping of building-integrated technologies to
increase energy generation or decrease energy consumption during
operation, and use of artificial intelligence algorithms to improve
the design, construction and use of infrastructure systems.
2. Scientific computing for infrastructural materials. This
interest area involves discovery and/or characterization of novel
materials or repurposing of materials used in other applications to
improve the sustainability and resilience of infrastructure systems
and/or transform the design and construction methods that are
required to effectively use these new materials. Specific expertise
may include solid or fluid mechanics; molecular dynamics;
multi-scale modeling; topology optimization of materials;
metamaterials; soft matter; and advanced methods for experimental
validation.
3. Automation and artificial intelligence for urban
infrastructure systems. This interest area includes research
that leverages advances in automation technologies, including the
latest developments in robotics, AI, and sensors, to advance either
the design, control, maintenance, and construction of
infrastructure or the nature of urban mobility, considering
transportation of people and goods through connected vehicles,
intelligent infrastructure, and new types of sharing/on-demand
services. This area highlights the convergence of informatics,
automation, and advanced manufacturing processes in construction
and mobility technologies. A related area of interest is how these
automated technologies may amplify unequal social capitals and
cause extra environmental and economic burdens on vulnerable
populations and minorities.

Open Rank Professor of Sustainability (Tenure Line)
Georgetown University: Main Campus: Graduate School

Location: Washington, DC
Open Date: Oct 12, 2022
Deadline: Jan 02, 2023 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time

Description
The Earth Commons (ECo Institute) within the Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences (GSAS) seeks to hire a tenured faculty member at
the rank of Assistant, Associate or Full Professor. The faculty
member will be based within the ECo Institute, with their tenure
home within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The window of opportunity for reducing the human impact on the
environment and mitigating climate change is closing. Limiting
global warming to 1.5°C to prevent irreversible environmental
damage requires knowledgeable scientists, researchers, and
policymakers who understand the urgency of the situation and can
develop and devise attainable solutions, communicate sustainability
plans, and implement conservation strategies. At this point, there
is common recognition that solving most environmental problems
requires some incorporation of sustainability planning and
scholarship.

The ideal candidate is an interdisciplinary scholar whose
background includes Sustainability science, environmental systems,
and/or materials science but also has demonstrated ability to
connect with related areas of sustainability. This includes
engaging with policymakers, implementing strategies and solutions
through partnerships with stakeholders, and communicating research
and planning activities to diverse audiences. The successful
candidate would develop a strong research program at the interface
of multiple areas, including but not limited to areas such as
sustainability science and policy, materials science, waste
science, life-cycle design and assessment, product design, energy
systems, food systems, water and marine systems, ecosystem
services, urbanism and ruralities, and environmental systems
dynamics.

We are looking for a scholar with a stellar record of research and
fundraising, who is on track for a distinguished career within
their own discipline and has potential to contribute significantly
to interdisciplinary efforts. The ideal candidate will have a
demonstrated track record of communicating their academic research
both to the general public and to policymakers in person, as well
as through the media. They will also have experience teaching
students using experiential and active learning techniques.

This faculty member would contribute to the development and
delivery of our innovative pedagogical and experiential components
for the new undergraduate curricula, and would help connect our
various environmental and material science faculty with the ongoing
work of the Earth Commons and the Office of Sustainability. We seek
an individual who can lead efforts to communicate complex
sustainability-relevant science and scholarship to a broad
audience, with demonstrated success in innovative broad outreach
and a passion for building capacity within the Earth Commons.

The successful applicant will bring an interdisciplinary
perspective to teaching and research and will have a strong
commitment to securing funding for building a successful research
program. Candidates will have the opportunity to contribute to the
teaching and research of many programs on campus. Besides shaping
the content of new courses and contributing to program development
that meets the needs of the newly launched Master of Science in
Environment and Sustainability Management (https://esm.georgetown.edu), the faculty member would
also contribute to other emerging interdisciplinary environmental
programs and degrees of the ECo Institute - an undergraduate major,
university wide minor, and other master's concentrations.

The ECo Institute is a rapidly growing entity and will be located,
at least in part, on the downtown capital campus. This position
with a focus on Environmental Sustainability is central to
Georgetown's efforts to be a leader in environment and
sustainability, teaching and in action. All of the candidates must
possess a Ph.D., have a strong academic background and a
demonstrated potential for excellence in research grant
acquisition.

As the ECo Institute looks to grow its faculty, it is building
bridges with schools and programs across the university. In that
regard, this new tenure line hire will join the Georgetown
community as part of a broader faculty cluster hire of at least
four faculty (three tenure and one non-tenure line) in the
Environmental Sciences. The ECo Institute is committed to hiring
dedicated scientists who will be able to support, deepen, and
enhance the important research and teaching in the areas of
Environmental Science, Climate Science, Environmental Economics,
and Sustainability, and to develop new impactful programs and
degrees. Joint appointments will be made between the ECo Institute
and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with the McDonough
School of Business, the School of Foreign Service, the College of
Arts and Sciences, and other relevant STEM departments and
units.

Position responsibilities will be a split of 60% Extension duties and 40% research/teaching duties. The incumbent will provide leadership in research and Extension activities related to cropping systems water quality in Wisconsin and engage in teaching in related areas. An integrative and applied approach to research is expected, working with multidisciplinary teams of research scientists, Extension specialists, and community partners. Leadership is needed in the development, evaluation, interpretation, and application of new approaches for effective field, watershed and regional applications of multi-scale research.

Research will address problems related to agricultural water quality in cropping systems and associated environmental and human health impacts. This would include, but not be limited to: resource management and risk assessment of croplands, grasslands, pastures, and/or waterways; irrigation water quality and its relationship with groundwater quality (for irrigation and human use/consumption); local, watershed-scale, and regional assessment of pollution mitigation efforts and agricultural best management practices; and configuration and composition of cropping systems to eliminate or reduce contaminant and pollution loss. Additional examples of research topics include perennial intercropping systems, real-time irrigation water contaminant sampling, landscape-level cropping system composition and configuration to reduce nutrient and pesticide losses, nutrient and pesticide delivery systems and materials that reduce leaching and runoff, in-field bioremediation, enhanced on-farm filtration systems such as wetlands, and refined water conservation systems. Cropping systems currently studied in the Agronomy and Horticulture departments at UW-Madison include annual fruits, vegetables, and grains; perennial specialty crops and forages; and natural and cultivated landscapes.

Thus, the Departments of Agronomy and Horticulture seek a 9-month tenure track Cropping Systems Water Quality Specialist to address problems related to agricultural water quality and associated environmental and human health impacts.

The Cropping Systems Water Quality Specialist will possess strong 'systems thinking' skills and the ability to integrate biological, physical, and economic variables that interact within and among agroecosystems at the field, farm, and landscape levels. The incumbent will develop and lead research and Extension programs that embody the mission of the College of Agricultural & Life Sciences. The incumbent will also develop, lead and partner with collaborative teams to obtain funding to develop, manage, and increase adoption of agroecosystems that fit the aforementioned problems. Commitment to Extension and outreach activities and documenting impact of efforts is a critical component of this position, as is mentoring, supporting and developing students in a collaborative environment. The Departments of Agronomy and Horticulture are committed to inclusivity and diversity; therefore, we strongly encourage applications from candidates who foster and promote these values.
The candidate will be expected to:
1. Develop an independent, extramurally-funded and recognized Extension and research program at the state, regional, national, and international levels.
2. Generate, translate, and apply research-based knowledge and methods to issues and problems by integrating Extension and research activities into a coherent body of work. CALS Extension-funded faculty are expected to provide leadership in the design, development, and implementation of Extension programs and to document the impact of these efforts.
3. Teach graduate and undergraduate students, commensurate with college expectations and consistent with the teaching loads of the department. Mentor students and promote their development and success in a collaborative environment.
4. Contribute to outreach and service functions of the department, college, university, and professional societies.
5. Contribute to programs aimed at increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion within the department, college, and university. Promote an inclusive and diverse climate within our campus and associated communities.
Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.

Initial appointment to this position will be for a term of 4 years beginning fall of 2023, and will carry the rank of Assistant Professor.
The Oberlin Studio Art department offers a creative platform for students who want intensive studio training combined with the intellectual rigor of a liberal arts curriculum. Oberlin artists are thinking artists, deeply engaged in their intellectual and creative pursuits. Our world-renowned faculty offer courses in painting, drawing, color theory, photography (wet and digital), sculpture, installation, media arts (sound, video, interactive/networked art), performance, reproducible media (screen print, lithography, intaglio, relief, monotype, digital), and all the hybrids in between. Drawing on their parallel studies at Oberlin, our students produce work at the forefront of creative fields. Oberlin’s Studio Art curriculum is interdisciplinary in nature, and emphasizes ideas. Even skills-based courses use ideas as prompts, from the political histories of color to the concept of “nature” as it has been defined by landscape painting. Supporting our diverse mediums and the conceptual depth of our courses, our curriculum’s guiding structure is radically simple: physical dimensions. Our 2D courses focus on color, composition, design, and mediums on a flat plane; 3D courses emphasize tools and techniques to build in and re-envision in space; 4D courses address time-based media, and most digital mediums. By the time a student graduates from Oberlin’s Studio Art department—regardless of their primary medium—they will be fluent in visual languages across all (known) physical dimensions, preparing them to be critical thinkers and active participants in our 21st century visual world.
The incumbent will teach the standard teaching load (4.5 courses per year) in the general area of sculpture & installation. The Studio Art requirements are designated by physical dimensions––2D, 3D, and 4D––and this professor is the primary continuing professor to provide instruction in 3D processes. These may include wood-working, mold-making, casting, carving, modeling, assemblage, digital input/output and physical computing processes (CNC, laser cutter, etc.), metal work, ceramics, fibers, earthworks, public art, social practice, and installation. This person will also participate in the department’s team-taught capstone sequence; they will necessarily think across dimensions and forms; they must be well-versed in interdisciplinary approaches and be able to teach advanced mixed-media courses. The Oberlin Studio Art department values intellectual rigor and conceptual depth art-making; as such, this professor will forge new interdisciplinary relationships with departments across campus.
The incumbent will also be expected to engage in sustained scholarly research and/or other creative work appropriate to the position and participate in the full range of faculty responsibilities, including academic advising and service on committees.
Among the qualifications required for appointment is the MFA degree in hand. Candidates must demonstrate interest and potential excellence in undergraduate teaching. Successful teaching experience at the college level is desirable. Oberlin College is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. The incumbent will bring understanding of or experience working with underrepresented and diverse academic populations. Oberlin is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the excellence and diversity of the academic community through their research, teaching, and service.

therapy. Candidates whose research focus is upon a cancer that
shows health disparities in our local catchment area are especially
encouraged to apply.

Cancer research at SDSU is further facilitated by extensive
interaction with the UCSD Moores Cancer Center, with whom SDSU is a
consortium partner. The successful faculty member will be eligible
for membership in the Cancer Center and will be encouraged to work
collaboratively with UCSD faculty to further strengthen this
partnership.

opportunities abound at SDSU as well as at our two Imperial Valley
campuses (Brawley and
Calexico). For example, SDSU is home to one large NIH cooperative
agreement, the SDSU
HealthLINK Center, as well as many other Centers and Institutes
focused on the health of underrepresented communities (SDSU Centers and
Institutes). SDSU Imperial Valley is home to the recently

SDSU, including the County of San Diego Health and Human Services
Agency, UCSD, Moores Cancer Center, USD, CSU San Marcos,
Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Scripps Whittier
Diabetes Institute, Scripps Research Translation Institute, Salk
Institute, Sanford Burnham Prebys, local pharmaceutical and biotech
industries, Federally Qualified Health Centers, etc. SDSU is home
to a diverse student and faculty body. Over a third of our
students, both undergraduate and graduate, are underrepresented
minorities. SDSU is approximately 40 minutes from the U.S.-Mexico
border and has a trolley line that extends directly to the border
crossing to Mexico, thus facilitating research collaboration with
faculty and students from universities in Tijuana. The San Diego
region is a large metropolitan area with a wide range of diverse
communities, which include newly arrived immigrants and refugees
from many countries, and centuries-old Native American tribes and
bands.

SDSU is the oldest institution of higher education in the San Diego
region, with a campus and microsites in San Diego and locations in
Southern California’s Imperial Valley and Tbilisi in the Republic
of Georgia. The highly diverse campus community has a student
population of approximately 36,000. SDSU is included in the
Carnegie Foundation’s Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity
category. Established in 1897, SDSU offers bachelor degrees in 97
areas, masters in 84 and doctorates in 23. See http://www.sdsu.edu for more
information. SDSU is a large, diverse, urban university and HSI
with a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence.
Our campus community is diverse in many ways, including race,
religion, color, sex, age, disability, marital status, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, national origin,
pregnancy, medical condition, and covered veteran status. We strive
to build and sustain a welcoming environment for all.

SDSU strives for equity and inclusion in everything it does,
building on the human and intellectual diversity of students,
faculty, and staff as a source of innovation and strength. SDSU is
ranked 35 nationwide for ethnic diversity, and roughly 54% of the
university's undergraduates and graduates are students from
historically marginalized populations. SDSU is the No. 1
LGBTQ+-friendly campus in California, and No. 8 nationally,
according to Campus Pride and BestColleges. ​Further, the
university is consistently ranked as a top school for veterans and
serves more than 4,000 military-connected students. As a
U.S.-Mexico transborder HSI, SDSU launched its Inaugural Global
Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish in Spring 2021 to value and honor the
language of our California/Baja California region. Most critically,
the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion translate to
results: Continuation and degree completion rates have increased
over the last decade, and equity gaps have begun to close
effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.

The SDSU Mission Valley Innovation District offers new
opportunities for collaboration and entrepreneurship, with 1.6
million square feet of research and innovation space that will be
developed primarily through public and private partnerships. SDSU
researchers and Innovation District partners will work together to

Considered a biodiversity hotspot, Lower Rio Grande Valley and the
surrounding region lie at the confluence of the desert, temperate,
and tropical biomes, which have undergone significant fragmentation
due to agricultural expansion and subsequent urbanization. Multiple
understudied environments exist that are ripe for developing a

habitats with disturbance statuses ranging from degraded to
restored to managed to pristine. The region boasts over half the US
bird species, 42% of all U.S. butterfly species, and 45 federal and
state threatened or endangered species. Within a 150-mile radius,
there are multiple National Wildlife Refuges, State Parks, and
private reserves, even as industrialization (e.g., SpaceX, LNG,

CS Program

The CS program at CSUMB, in collaboration with our partners, is
re-examining approaches to computer science higher education,
especially as it relates to broadening participation in the field
and decreasing cost and time to degree. In the past 10 years, we
have received over $20 million in external funding to develop
initiatives and projects that aim to meet these ends. One of our
most significant efforts to date is a cohort-based education model
launched in 2013 that graduates students in 4 years or less, and
primarily serves students who come from low socioeconomic
backgrounds, are first-generation college students, and are of
ethnicity or gender traditionally underrepresented in CS.

This effort has been recognized as one of the top-5 innovative
ideas in higher education by CA state with a $5M award. Recognizing
the importance of the tech industry to California's economy and the
importance of providing opportunities similar to the ones built at
CSUMB's CS program to students across the state, the CA Governor's
office has allotted $10M funding to launch a statewide Computing Talent
Initiative. Our success in producing well-prepared candidates
for entry-level positions combined with the atypically diverse
nature of our CS graduates has also resulted in significant
interest and support from many Silicon Valley companies.

An ideal candidate will be interested in becoming part of a team in
these efforts to help drive continuous improvement of the entire
program, while also developing new initiatives that align with the
overall program goals.

story of this historic institution. It is committed to academic
excellence and diversity, equity and inclusion among its faculty,
classified professionals, and students. The college takes
responsibility for equitable outcomes and successful pathways for
all students.

of anti-racism, we create dynamic communities of respect and
inquiry which encourage student success and lifelong learning while

social and historical context of exclusionary practices in American
Higher Education.

Social Justice: We are focused on removing
institutional barriers, taking responsibility for and mitigating
systemic barriers. We are invested in validating our students’
lived experiences through examining qualitative and quantitative
data which enhances our understanding of intersectionality. This

practices. Servimos y empoderamos (we serve and empower)
marginalized and racially-minoritized individuals, communities, and
histories. With invested community partners, we build programs

Position Announcement

The University of Oregon's Department of Linguistics invites
applications for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in
Linguistics, to begin in fall 2023. We seek candidates specializing
in language description based on primary data collection, with
training and research orientation that will further our
department's commitment to functional/usage-based approaches to
linguistic explanation. We particularly welcome applications from
scholars who are members of Indigenous language communities or from
other populations historically underrepresented in the academy,
and/or whose life experience would contribute unique perspectives.
Similarly, we seek applicants who will contribute to excellence in
teaching students from diverse backgrounds at the undergraduate and
graduate levels.
Department or Program Summary

We are a growing department structured in its research and graduate
program around 3 broad themes: linguistic diversity & society;
language learning & technology; and language processing &
human health. We share a usage-based approach to understanding
language patterns, with strengths in functionalist approaches to
syntax, language description and revitalization, historical
linguistics, experimental linguistics, laboratory phonology,
language acquisition and teaching, and variationist
sociolinguistics. Most Ph.D. dissertation research at the
University of Oregon is in either language documentation (usually
describing languages not previously documented), experimental
research (including laboratory phonology, discourse studies,
gesture, and semantics), second language acquisition and teaching,
and, increasingly, language revitalization as a research endeavor.

program of field research on an under-described language or
language family, and will possess thorough knowledge of relevant
technology and software. We are open to specializations in any
subfield that is related to the analysis of morphosyntax and
semantics. We especially welcome candidates who specialize in the
analysis of language in use, broadly conceived. This can include
working on linguistic anthropology, discourse analysis, information
structure, small-corpus analysis, or any related topic. We are also
interested in scholars who will enhance the department's existing
strengths in historical linguistics, usage-based approaches to
syntax, laboratory phonology, applied linguistics, and language
revitalization, and/or who will complement our current expertise
with other strengths such as experimental and/or computational
approaches in fieldwork. The best applications will also highlight

years, with regular reappointments and opportunities for
advancement along this track. With this new position, Bucknell's
Biomedical Engineering Department is seeking a faculty colleague
passionate about innovation in undergraduate BME education. We
expect to hire at the assistant professor level but are open to
considering outstanding candidates at other ranks. This position is
ideal for candidates interested in a teaching-focused career in
academia with an emphasis on undergraduate instruction, curriculum
development and innovation, student engagement, and departmental
and college community.

This 9-month, teaching professor position includes a 6 course
teaching load split over two semesters, with additional
expectations of new course development, departmental contributions,
college and university service and undergraduate student advising.
A candidate interested in pursuing enhanced service,
administrative, or leadership opportunities at Bucknell could seek
a reduction in teaching load in consultation with the department
chair (contingent upon the needs of the department). Such pursuits
should be student-focused and could include, but are not limited
to, development of clinical and/or community-based learning
experiences for students, healthcare technology design,
cross-college connections to the liberal arts or management,
inclusive excellence efforts, accreditation activities, or other
supplemental educational activities for students. Optional
compensated summer student engagement opportunities are also
possible, including clinical collaborations, supporting College of
Engineering programs such as Engineering Camp and the engineering
EXCELerator, teaching summer courses, and participation in
cross-college initiatives.

This new colleague would join a top-ranked, highly selective
undergraduate biomedical engineering department with small class
sizes (< 24 students) that facilitates close student-faculty
interaction in an inclusive, hands-on, and interactive learning
community. The University sponsors a range of developmental
activities for all its faculty supported by a well-resourced
Teaching and Learning Center. Candidates would have the potential
to engage in innovative teaching within Bucknell's excellent core
facilities, notably our recently opened BME teaching and laboratory
facilities (Fall 2019). Bucknell's Biomedical Engineering
Department is uniquely situated in a liberal arts university
including three colleges (Arts & Sciences, Engineering,
Management), facilitating opportunities for cross-disciplinary
collaborations in teaching and pedagogical scholarship. The
department also has collaborative relationships with regional
medical centers and the healthcare infrastructure.

We seek individuals with enthusiasm for undergraduate classroom and
laboratory teaching that incorporates evidence-based pedagogy and
inclusive and active learning techniques. The ideal candidate would
have teaching abilities in multiple areas to support a biomedical
engineering curriculum containing courses in bioinstrumentation,
signals and systems, biomechanics, materials, biostatistics,
computing, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and medical
device design. Individuals with a strong desire to develop
innovative student experiential learning activities and broaden
students' perspectives through curricular or co-curricular
activities are especially encouraged to apply. In addition,
candidates would be encouraged to intellectually engage with the
broader biomedical engineering education community at the local and
national level, e.g., attending ASEE and BMES conferences.
Financial support for professional development activities, such as
conferences and workshops, is included in the position.

Applications must include a cover letter, a current C.V., and three
statements of no more than two pages each describing the
applicant's 1) evidence of a commitment to diversity and engaging
students in an inclusive classroom environment, 2) teaching
philosophy, experience relevant to the Bucknell biomedical
engineering curriculum, and identification of current required and
new elective courses they would be interested in teaching at
Bucknell, and 3) ideas for 2-3 innovations or pedagogies in
undergraduate BME education that they would be interested in
pursuing at Bucknell. Applicants should be prepared to provide
references upon request. Applications will only be accepted online
through Bucknell's career site (careers.bucknell.edu) and they will
be reviewed beginning on November 1, 2022 until the position is
filled.

Minimum Qualifications:A successful
candidate must be ABD or have a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering or
a closely related discipline at time of appointment. Clear evidence
of the potential for teaching excellence is essential, and a strong
interest in continued professional development is expected. The
candidate should demonstrate a commitment to working successfully
with a diverse student body, utilizing inclusive pedagogies, and
fostering highly collaborative environments.

Work Type:
This full time, 9-month, teaching professor position.

POSITION TITLE: Studio Art: Social
Practice/Community-Based Art

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:

The Department of Art at Sacramento State is one of ten departments
in the College of Arts and Letters and is accredited by the
National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). As
California's capital university, we teach students in the visual
arts, preparing them for lifelong creative and scholarly endeavors.
We embrace and cultivate a diverse community of artists, scholars,
and leaders. The department offers a BFA and an MFA in Studio Art,
as well as BAs in Art, Art History, and Art Education. Through our
courses, exhibitions, lectures and public programs, we introduce
students and the local community to the expressive world of the
fine arts.

The Department also promotes an appreciation and understanding of
the fine arts in the general student population. A wide variety of
approaches based on both Western and Non-Western cultures are
integrated into courses that are oriented toward creativity,
imagination, and critical thinking. Students can explore art
through courses in art education, art history, ceramics, new media
art, painting, printmaking, and sculpture. Studio experiences
develop the creative and artistic skills necessary for mastery of
established styles and exploration of new ones. Art history classes
provide an appreciation for and an understanding of our visual
cultural heritage within a historical context. Courses in art
education provide an understanding of the behavioral aspects of
art, with regard to the creator, the viewer, and the developing
person. The Department of Art serves as a significant cultural
resource in the region through the sponsorship of art exhibits,
workshops, lectures, and symposia each academic year. The
department extends its influence out into the community through the
involvement of its faculty, staff, and students in projects,
activities, and events off campus.

Sacramento is the state capital of California and one of the most
diverse cities in the nation. As the heart of the region's higher
education community, Sac State is a Minority Serving Institution
(MSI), Asian American & Native American Pacific
Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), and a Hispanic Serving
Institution (HSI), dedicated to access, academic excellence, and

COLLEGE: College of Arts and
Letters

DEPARTMENT: Department of
Art

POSITION TITLE: Assistant Professor -
Interdisciplinary Ceramic Artist

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:The Department of Art at
Sacramento State is one of ten departments in the College of Arts
and Letters and is accredited by the National Association of
Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). As California's capital
university, we teach students in the visual arts, preparing them
for lifelong creative and scholarly endeavors. We embrace and
cultivate a diverse community of artists, scholars, and leaders.
The department offers a BFA and an MFA in Studio Art, as well as
BAs in Art, Art History, and Art Education. Through our courses,
exhibitions, lectures and public programs, we introduce students
and the local community to the expressive world of the fine arts.
The department also promotes an appreciation and understanding of
the fine arts in the general student population. A wide variety of
approaches based on both Western and Non-Western cultures are
integrated into courses that are oriented toward creativity,
imagination, and critical thinking. Students can explore art
through courses in art education, art history, ceramics, new media
art, painting, printmaking, and sculpture. Studio experiences
develop the creative and artistic skills necessary for mastery of
established styles and exploration of new ones. Art history classes
provide an appreciation for and an understanding of our visual
cultural heritage within a historical context. Courses in art
education provide an understanding of the behavioral aspects of
art, with regard to the creator, the viewer, and the developing
person.
The Department of Art serves as a
significant cultural resource in the region through the sponsorship
of art exhibits, workshops, lectures, and symposia each academic
year. It extends its influence out into the community through the
involvement of its faculty, staff, and students in projects,
activities, and events off campus. Our undergraduate and graduate
students reflect our campus community, with students from varied
racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender minority backgrounds, most
working full or part-time, and many being first-generation college
students. The candidate should demonstrate preparedness to advise
and mentor a diverse body of students, foster inclusivity both in
the classroom and through recruitment, and collaborate with Art
Studio, Art Education, and Art History colleagues as well as other
University and community partners.

POSITION DETAILS:The Art Department seeks a
Ceramic artist with an environmental/social justice focus, that
will help the department serve an increasingly diverse student
body. The candidate's practice should demonstrate a strong

social justice, which may include, but are not limited to, climate
and environmental activism; centering indigeneity; and/or
intersectionality in communities of color. The candidate's artistic
and teaching practice should reflect new developments in the field,
such as initiatives to decolonize the curriculum, adoption of
interdisciplinary approaches, sustainability, and/or integration of
innovative methods and new technologies. The Art Department is
keenly interested in diversifying its faculty and encourages
applications from historically underrepresented groups in higher
education. This is a full-time, tenure-track position at the
