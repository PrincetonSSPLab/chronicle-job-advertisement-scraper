Description

The Department of Arts and Entertainment Technologies (AET) in the
School of Design and Creative Technologies (SDCT) at The University
of Texas at Austin seeks a faculty colleague with a focus in Game
Design for computer media applications. Rank and salary
commensurate with experience. Position requires relocation to
Austin, TX.

We are cultivating a team of future focused collaborators committed
to transforming education for a diverse community of creators.
Entering our 5th year, AET has become the largest undergraduate
program in the College of Fine Arts, with student interest
increasing year-over-year. Young and vibrant, AET is home to 400
energetic students who embody a diversity of interests,
backgrounds, and lived experiences.

We're making great strides - graduating successful students who've
been hired at top-shelf companies, establishing partnerships with
big industry names, and sustaining high impact university
collaborations. Our curriculum is well positioned to partner with
industries defining the future of creative technologies.

Responsibilities of this position may include:

Overseeing and coordinating game design courses and curricula
that prepare students for careers and integrate with the various
disciplines practiced in AET and SDCT; cultivate clear student
outcomes and promote an inclusive student experience.
Developing and teaching introductory, intermediate, and

in your areas of expertise, and team-taught interdisciplinary
courses.

interdisciplinary goals.
Collaborating with the community/industry for student career
opportunities.

courses.



We are working to ensure that the creators and consumers of arts
and entertainment technologies are people of diverse races,
ethnicities, genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic
statuses, nationalities, and linguistic and cultural traditions.
Recognizing that many AET professions in the United States today
are negatively impacted by systemic discrimination such as white
supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and elitism, we invite applications
from academics and practitioners whose teaching, scholarship,
professional practice, creative activity, and/or service disrupts
this tradition; we especially welcome applications from candidates
belonging to groups underrepresented in higher education, including
women, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQIA people, and people
with disabilities.

Qualifications

To be considered for this position, candidates must:


Hold a terminal degree in your field by date of hire, OR
possess a record of equivalent professional experience or
scholarly/creative achievement.
Demonstrate a high level of craft in one or more aspects of
game design, including expertise in designing, testing, and
deploying solutions to common game design challenges; thorough
understanding of industry standard game design principles and
processes; experience in applying game design within non-gaming
domains such as automotive, architecture, medical, marketing, or
other contexts.
Demonstrate experience developing coursework and/or teaching
materials for beginning through advanced college-age learners.
Demonstrate diversity and inclusion skills in a professional
and/or educational context.


Application Instructions

To apply for the position, please submit the following to
Interfolio at https://apply.interfolio.com/97882:

interest in, the position, including discussion of your most
significant professional/creative research, teaching, and service

teaching, service, and/or creative research.

A link to or pdf of a portfolio of recent creative coding or
relevant professional work.
Contact information for three references (letters will be
requested only for finalists).
(Optional) A statement describing your work in Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion.

review. Applications received after that date will be reviewed as

restrictions, we expect to conduct all interviews remotely.
