COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY

With the goal of ensuring the equal educational opportunity of all
students, Santa Monica College embraces diversity among students,
faculty, staff, and the communities we serve as an integral part of
our history, a recognition of the complexity of our present state,
and a call to action for a better future. Embracing diversity means
that we must intentionally practice equity and respect toward one
another, and understand that discrimination and prejudices create
and sustain privileges for some while creating and sustaining
barriers for others. In order to embrace diversity, we also
acknowledge that institutional discrimination and implicit bias
exist, and that our goal is to eradicate those vestiges from our
system. Our commitment to diversity requires that we strive to
eliminate those barriers to equity, and that we act deliberately to
create a safe and positive environment where individual and group
differences are valued and leveraged for our growth and
understanding as an educational community.

To advance the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and social
justice for the success of students and employees, we must honor
that each individual is unique and that our individual differences
contribute to the ability of the college to prepare students on
their educational journeys. This requires that we develop and
implement policies and procedures, encourage individual and
systemic change, continually reflect on our efforts, and hold
ourselves accountable for the results of our efforts in
accomplishing our goals.

We are invested as a community in cultivating and maintaining a
climate where equity and mutual respect are both intrinsic and
explicit by valuing individuals and groups from all backgrounds,
demographics, and experiences. Individual and group differences can
include, but are not limited to the following dimensions: race,
ethnicity, national origin or ancestry, citizenship, immigration
status, sex, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental
disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status,
registered domestic partner status, age, religion, creed, military
or veteran status, socioeconomic status, and any other basis
protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or
regulation. We acknowledge that the concept of inclusion and
diversity is ever-evolving, thus we create space to allow our
understanding to grow through the periodic review of this
statement. In service of these goals, Santa Monica College is
committed to fostering an employment environment that offers equal
employment opportunity for all and an educational environment that
ensures the equal educational opportunity of all students.

Classification Title:

AST/ASO Professor

Job Description:

The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) invites
applications of interest for investigators in cancer and aging
research. We are seeking promising faculty at the
Assistant/Associate Professor level to fill gaps in current
knowledge in basic, clinical, and population sciences in cancer at
the intersection of aging. Appointments are on the tenure track,
and accompanied by significant resources to support faculty
research. This position will join a robust cohort of investigators
as part of the UFHCC Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS)
research program, led by Dejana Braithwaite, PhD, Associate
Director for Population Sciences. The mission of the CCPS program
is to reduce the cancer burden and associated risk factors in
Northern Florida and beyond.

Alongside the UFHCC, the University of Florida is home to the
Pepper Center for Older Americans, the Institute on Aging, and a
growing transdisciplinary research initiative on Cancer and Aging.
Embracing socio-ecological and biopsychosocial models, this
initiative seeks to transform the understanding of cancer and
aging. Outstanding opportunities exist to advance this initiative,
spanning basic science to clinical practice and policy; there are
also opportunities for clinician-researchers to establish clinical
services for older individuals with cancer.

Current research includes a robust portfolio of NIH or other
similar peer-reviewed funded studies in cancer control and
population sciences; healthy aging and biopsychosocial outcomes in
older populations at risk for or diagnosed with cancer; mechanisms
of accelerated aging; animal models of cancer and aging; and pilot
interventions to improve functioning. Other research focuses on
artificial intelligence approaches to cancer control and ‘real

together, with minimal conflict.

About the College of Medicine at the University of

Located in Gainesville since 1906, The University of Florida (UF)
has 16 colleges, a major academic health center, a championship
winning athletic program, a top-ranked undergraduate online program
and, in keeping with its land-grant mission, one of the nation's
most comprehensive agriculture and natural resources programs. All

historic red-brick core with advanced facilities and preserved

Several qualities distinguish UF among today's leading public
research universities. The first is its highly comprehensive

colleges of journalism, engineering, and medicine. The second is
its unwavering support from the state of Florida, which has
endorsed UF's drive to become one of the nation's very best public

hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding to grow its
faculty ranks by 500 members. UF's third exceptional

The University of Florida

Located in Gainesville since 1906, The University of Florida (UF)
has 16 colleges, a major academic health center, a championship
winning athletic program, a top-ranked undergraduate online program
and, in keeping with its land-grant mission, one of the nation's
most comprehensive agriculture and natural resources programs. All
are based at the University's 2,000-acre campus, joining its
historic red-brick core with advanced facilities and preserved
natural areas and connecting to adjacent innovation, commercial and
residential districts.

UF has 55,000 students, 30,000 employees, 5,500 faculty members, a
$5 billion annual budget and more than 140 mission-focused units
across the state of Florida. It is the Sunshine State's only member
of the Association of American Universities comprising the nation's
60 leading public and private research universities. More than
51,000 students have applied as freshmen for the 2021-22 academic
year — a new record.

Several qualities distinguish UF among today's leading public
research universities. The first is its highly comprehensive
breadth on a single campus, facilitating interdisciplinary
collaboration among, for example, faculty within the adjacent
colleges of journalism, engineering, and medicine. The second is
its unwavering support from the state of Florida, which has
endorsed UF's drive to become one of the nation's very best public
research universities — supporting those efforts since 2013 with
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding to grow its
faculty ranks by 500 members. UF's third exceptional quality is its
dynamism. Like Florida, the nation's third-largest state and among
the fastest-growing, UF is undergoing rapid transformation as it
pursues the overarching aspiration to be ""a premier university that
the state, nation and world look to for leadership.”

The City of Gainesville

Our campus is in Gainesville, a vibrant and growing community that
has numerous cultural amenities in a setting with great natural
beauty (see http://www.visitgainesville.com/arts-culture-history/).
Gainesville is home to Florida's largest and oldest university, and
so is one of the state's centers of education, medicine, cultural
events and athletics. The University of Florida and UF Health
Shands Hospital are the leading employers in Gainesville and
provide jobs for many residents of surrounding counties.
Gainesville is also the largest city in Alachua County and is the
county seat, with approximately 269,000 residents county-wide. It
serves as the cultural, educational and commercial center for the
north central Florida region and ranks highly on pet-friendly
scorecards. Additionally, the city owns a regional transit system,
a regional airport just minutes from town, a 72-par championship
golf course, and many miles of paved and cross-country bike trails.
Known for its preservation of historic buildings and the beauty of
its natural surroundings, Gainesville's numerous parks, museums,
lakes, and crystal-clear springs provide outdoor entertainment to
thousands of visitors. Because of its beautiful landscape and urban
""forest,"" Gainesville is one of the most attractive cities in
Florida. The city is in a central location to both the Gulf of
Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, providing easy access within a day's
drive to beaches, nature preserves, and water-based activities.

Classification Title:

ASO/FULL PROF

Job Description:

The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of
Florida invites applications for a tenured/tenure-track faculty
position at the rank of Associate or Full Professor for an Endowed
Professorship in the Department of Computer & Information
Science & Engineering (CISE).

Specific area recruiting for/brief description of duties. This
endowed professorship is to support a faculty leader in research on
ethical AI systems, including the development of AI methods and
their applications in CISE-related fields. The recipient will
conduct research at the intersection of technology and society with
the specific goal of recognizing and understanding potential harms
when AI algorithms are embedded in societal applications and the
mechanisms can be used for monitoring and control. The recipient
may also conduct research on how AI changes the nature of
human-technology interaction over time.

Major research thrust areas include but not limited to:

(1) Algorithmic fairness and development of socially
conscious/aware algorithms: There is an intrinsic trade-off between
computational accuracy and algorithm fairness (accounting for
societal context) in developing predictive tools. This
professorship will address contextual factors in algorithm
prototyping and development. A burgeoning area of research interest
is in “fairness gerrymandering” or the case in which an algorithm
appears fair across individual groups but a subgroup characteristic
leads to a heavy bias against one or more particular groups (e.g.,
uniform marketing of services across groups but with some groups
being incapable of using services).

(2) Algorithmic Interpretability: Many machine learning tools are
labeled as “black box algorithms” due to a lack of causal
explanation of how inputs are transformed to outputs. There is a
need for further understanding of causes and effects of changes
within a model to allow for transfer of machine learning into the
broader human knowledge base. Algorithm transparency is also
instrumental in guarding against embedded bias.

(3) Study of legal, ethical, and social consequences of AI-driven
technology and decision making.

The professorship may also support faculty research related to
ethics beyond AI, including data handling. Study of data privacy,
anonymization, and differential privacy (sharing information about
a dataset without revealing personal information of individuals)
are also considered within the scope of this appointment.

Expected Salary:

Salary to commensurate with education and experience.

Minimum Requirements:

PhD in Computer Science, or related field is required.

Preferred Qualifications:

The preferred candidate will have skills in, AI, Machine Learning,
Ethics, Bias

Special Instructions to Applicants:

The search committee will begin reviewing applications immediately
and will continue to receive applications until the position is
filled. All applications must be submitted through UFCareers at:

following files in PDF format: (1) cover letter (summary,
introduction related to hiring emphasis areas); (2) a
curriculum vitae; and (3) the names, addresses, phone numbers, and
email addresses of no less than three and up to five references.
Additionally, please combine items 4-6 in one PDF and
upload to the “other documents” selection in the
application. (4) Diversity Statement describing the
applicant's experience in enhancing diversity, equity and including
through research, teaching, or services, and vision for promoting a
more inclusive experience at the University of Florida. (5)
Research program vision statement. (6) Teaching statement. The
anticipated start for the position is Spring 2023 with some
flexibility for a later start based on individual needs. For

The University of Florida

Located in Gainesville since 1906, The University of Florida (UF)
has 16 colleges, a major academic health center, a championship
winning athletic program, a top-ranked undergraduate online program
and, in keeping with its land-grant mission, one of the nation's
most comprehensive agriculture and natural resources programs. All
are based at the University's 2,000-acre campus, joining its
historic red-brick core with advanced facilities and preserved
natural areas and connecting to adjacent innovation, commercial and
residential districts.
UF has 55,000 students, 30,000 employees, 5,500 faculty members, a
$5 billion annual budget and more than 140 mission-focused units
across the state of Florida. It is the Sunshine State's only member
of the Association of American Universities comprising the nation's
60 leading public and private research universities. More than
51,000 students have applied as freshmen for the 2021-22 academic
year — a new record.
Several qualities distinguish UF among today's leading public
research universities. The first is its highly comprehensive
breadth on a single campus, facilitating interdisciplinary
collaboration among, for example, faculty within the adjacent
colleges of journalism, engineering and medicine. The second is its
unwavering support from the state of Florida, which has endorsed
UF's drive to become one of the nation's very best public research
universities — supporting those efforts since 2013 with hundreds of
millions of dollars in additional funding to grow its faculty ranks
by 500 members. UF's third exceptional quality is its dynamism.
Like Florida, the nation's third-largest state and among the
fastest-growing, UF is undergoing rapid transformation as it
pursues the overarching aspiration to be ""a premier university that
the state, nation and world look to for leadership.”

The City of Gainesville

Gainesville (http://cityofgainesville.org)

athletics. The University of Florida and UF Health Shands Hospital

residents of surrounding counties. Gainesville is also the largest
city in Alachua County and is the county seat, with approximately

educational and commercial center for the north central Florida
region. The city provides a full range of municipal services,
including cultural and nature services and necessary administrative
services to support these activities. Additionally, the city owns a
regional transit system, a regional airport, and a 72-par
championship golf course. Known for its preservation of historic
buildings and the beauty of its natural surroundings, Gainesville's
numerous parks, museums and lakes provide entertainment to
thousands of visitors. Because of its beautiful landscape and urban
""forest,"" Gainesville is one of the most attractive cities in
Florida. The city is in a central location to both the Gulf of
Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, providing easy access within a day's
drive to beaches, nature preserves, and water-based activities.

The carbon cycle is at the heart of the climate crisis currently facing our planet, and it is important to build knowledge and understanding that underpins thriving social and ecological systems. To realize the potential of forests and forest products as solutions to the climate crisis, we need monumental advancements in our ability to assess and model the systems-level environmental impact of industrial activities in the carbon cycle. Relevant research approaches include forest management and the processing, utilization, reuse, and end of life of forest-based biomaterials. Design/eco-design of hybrid products, use of by-products/co-products, and substitution by alternative input sources should be analyzed from a systems perspective, requiring sophisticated models and intensive data collection and utilization. While life cycle analysis (LCA) is a regularly used tool, it is often employed narrowly. Use of system dynamics with data intensive LCA allows sophisticated cradle-to-cradle analysis of the impacts of material and process choices, thereby identifying critical sustainable development pathways. We seek a colleague who can apply novel theory and methods that will transcend LCA approaches. This person should be able to embrace data intensive, full-system dynamics, and circular economy consideration of the environmental impacts of material and process choices that impact the carbon cycle.

This full time, 9-month, tenure track appointment consists of a balance of instruction/teaching, research/scholarship, outreach, and service responsibilities, and is expected to begin as soon as July 1, 2023, and as late as September 16, 2023. The academic home of this faculty member will be their choice of either Wood Science and Engineering (WSE) or Forest Engineering, Resources, and Management (FERM), within the College of Forestry (CoF). The faculty member can supplement the salary during the summer through opportunities related to position duties (e.g., grants, summer teaching (study abroad), and contract testing). The new faculty member will have many opportunities to shape, expand, and diversify CoF’s reputation for excellence in research, undergraduate and graduate (masters and doctoral) instruction, as well as institutional and professional service. CoF is seeking a diversity of perspectives and welcomes applicants with a wide range of life and professional experiences.

About the University:

California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in 2002
as the newest campus in the California State University system.
Since that time, the University has grown and developed into one of
the premier public universities, not only in the California State
University system, but also in the nation. Indeed, U.S. News &
World Report listed CSUCI as 12th among “Top Public Universities in
the West” in the current edition of Best Colleges Rankings. In
2020, CollegeNET also ranked CSUCI 20th out of over 1,449 schools
in its “Social Mobility Index,” and Money Magazine rated CSUCI as
the 15th “Most Transformative College” in the nation.

CSUCI is a public comprehensive university that engages students in
critical inquiry and is dedicated to educating leaders for a global
society. The University is located in Ventura County and is home to
more than 5,470 undergraduate and 170graduate students.
Approximately 55% of CSUCI's students are Pell Grant eligible, and
approximately 62% are first-generation college students. CSUCI is
also proud to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution
(HSI), with 55% of its undergraduate students self-identifying as
Latinx, 25% as White, 6% as Asian/Asian American, 4% as
multiracial, and 2% as Black/African American. In 2019, CSUCI was
awarded Excelencia in Education's inaugural “Seal of Excelencia”
for its facilitation of Latinx student success. Also, in 2022, CI
became the first college to earn the Seal of Excelencia
recertification.

CSUCI is committed to diversifying its faculty in order to address
students' ever-changing needs in the 21st century. The University
is also taking steps to confront racism and to advocate for social
justice. To this end, CSUCI encourages applicants to apply who are
motivated to serve and contribute to the university's tenure-track
body, which self-identifies as 62% White, 21% Latinx, 9%
Asian/Asian American, and 2% Black/African American.

Diversity Statement:

CSUCI is committed to recruiting individuals who are dedicated to
furthering inclusive excellence in our campus community. We seek to
enhance our diverse University population by welcoming people from
all backgrounds, and by working to sustain an environment where
colleagues can not only work and learn, but also create and
thrive.

CSUCI Mission Statement:

Placing students at the center of the educational experience,
California State University Channel Islands provides undergraduate
and graduate education that facilitates learning within and across
disciplines through integrative approaches, emphasizes experiential
and service learning, and graduates students with multicultural and
international perspectives.

CSUCI's Commitment to You:

CSUCI is committed to helping newly hired faculty develop a sense
of belonging in a collaborative and supportive community dedicated
to providing resources and opportunities for establishing and
sustaining a research agenda and engaging in continuous improvement
in equitable teaching and learning.

About the Program:

The CSUCI Spanish Program currently offers a major and minor in
Spanish along with certificate programs in Spanish translation and
healthcare interpreting. We offer our diverse student body the
opportunity to develop their language skills and linguistic
knowledge while deepening their understanding of the peoples and
cultures of the Spanish-speaking world. Our wide range of classes
allows students to choose from courses focusing on language,
literature, linguistics, translation, interpretation, culture,
film, pedagogy, Spanish for the professions, and more. Our students
are also actively engaged in service-learning, community
engagement, and undergraduate research experiences. Many of our
students are also double majors and go on to successful careers in
education, healthcare, translation, business, non-profit, and a
diverse array of other professional pursuits.

As the newest Spanish program in the entire CSU system, there are
many opportunities for faculty to make innovative contributions at
CSUCI. We are a vibrant, interdisciplinary, and forward-looking
Spanish program. Our faculty are tirelessly committed in the
classroom and equally engaged in scholarly pursuits, which in turn
enriches our teaching.

We are seeking a colleague who can engage and inspire students
while contributing to the continued growth and development of a
Spanish program that helps students transform their own lives and
those of their families and communities. A large percentage of our
students are the first in their family to attend college. We seek
to assist them in acquiring tangible skills, knowledge, and
expertise so that they can make a meaningful impact in the
world.

Our Spanish faculty currently comprises two full professors, one
associate professor, one assistant professor, and several lecturer
colleagues. Given our small size, our tenure-track faculty teach a
wide array of classes and thus are able to build strong connections
with our students and serve as mentors along their path toward
graduation and beyond. The Spanish program currently serves
approximately 50 majors and 75 minors, with 100 students currently
enrolled in our Spanish Translation and Healthcare Interpreting
certificate programs. In addition to Spanish, the CI Global
Languages and Cultures Program (in the School of Arts and Sciences)
offers introductory courses in Chinese, French, Mixtec, American
Sign Language, and Arabic.
