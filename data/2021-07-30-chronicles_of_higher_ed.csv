these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:
The Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University
invites applications for one or more positions at the rank of
Assistant Teaching Professor/Associate Teaching Professor/Full
Teaching Professor in the Professional Masters Programs and in the
Align Program at Northeastern's Seattle campus beginning fall
2021.

Responsibilities:
We are seeking highly-motivated individuals committed to excellence
in teaching. Full-time appointments at all ranks are renewable,
career-focused non-tenure-track positions with responsibilities in
teaching and service. Opportunities for research and scholarship
are possible with course releases to make time for scholarship.
Primary responsibilities include teaching graduate courses at the
MS-level and in the Align Program (see below for a description). We
are searching across all areas of computer and data science.
Classes primarily meet in the evening and are small, with 10-40
students in a section. Faculty are supported with TAs and graders.
Successful candidates will create course content and materials, and
collaborate closely with colleagues across all Northeastern
University campuses (Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco, Seattle and
Silicon Valley). Student advising and service to the college and
university are an integral component of the position. Northeastern
University is a global university recognized by our renowned co-op
program and our focus on experiential learning.

The ALIGN bridges are designed for students from a variety of
undergraduate backgrounds who need supplemental technical courses
in order to matriculate into the Master of Science programs. ALIGN
consists of four courses emphasizing the foundational knowledge and
technical skills required for success in the respective Master of
Science programs.

The Challenge

Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor's degree recipients
but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented
minorities represent 25% of all bachelor's degree recipients but
just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only
address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social
equity and inclusion.

Our Solution

The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs
in several key ways. It is:


Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree
in CS

Coupled with Northeastern's famous co-op program to provide a
paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college's network of
500+ corporate partners

Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other
commitments and finish in 2.5 years

Offered locally at tech hubs across the country: Boston,
Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and
Silicon Valley.

Our 5 year pilot to date has already demonstrated a graduation rate
of 91%, with 100% employment and average salaries exceeding
$100,000. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for
tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the
program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more
than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be
underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a
diversity of race, gender and thought to America's tech workforce.
Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS
in CS, with Seattle being the Align program's original location.
The Seattle campus is in the heart of South Lake Union, and in
Computer Science we are growing rapidly, with currently 300
graduate students and projections to increase this significantly.
Classes are held on campus in both day and evening timeslots, and
we offer both the core Align program courses and a rich and growing
collection of electives in software engineering, artificial
intelligence and machine learning.

Please learn more about the Align program at our website, https://align.khoury.northeastern.edu/

Qualifications:
Candidates must hold a PhD in Computer and/or Information Science
or a related field from an accredited institution by the
appointment start date. Demonstrated ability or potential for
teaching excellence is required, but we will consider fresh PhDs.
Rank of appointment at the Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate
Teaching Professor, or Full Teaching Professor level will be
determined on teaching/scholarly record and will be discussed with
candidates during the interview process. Successful candidates will
have demonstrated an expert grasp of knowledge of the field and be
creative in their approach to teaching in an environment of
experiential education. Strong written, oral and interpersonal
skills are required in order to communicate effectively with
diverse and exceptional students in person and online. Successful
applicants are willing to teach in the evening and during summer
sessions if appropriate. For more information about the College,

Data/Data Analysis at the rank of Assistant Professor. The
opportunity to build a new research cluster across Design and Data
aligns both with DMSB's strategic plan to build leadership in
digital convergence, specifically in the area of data analytics,
with CAMD's focus on Data and Design, which encompasses data

perspectives on human experience as a process of making sense of
the world, participating in culture, and engaging with

With data and information becoming powerful, pervasive, and
controversial, we value accomplished designers and researchers
deeply committed to creating meaningful, data-oriented, and
human-driven experiences and services that balance the
opportunities for value creation for multiple organization
stakeholders with the threats inherent in data processes and
governance. Strong ability to master data transformations using
different methods and languages across multiple disciplines—along
with leveraging a broader framework to advance the field of design
research and scholarship—is also required.

We encourage candidates whose research creates value for a wide
range of firms and non-profit organizations by:

creating new methodologies for making data accessible, meaningful,
and actionable;

capturing, processing, and visualizing data effectively to inform
design processes and decisions and evaluate the value of
design;

creating data-driven design applications that incorporate consumer
insights to inform new product and service development;

designing for business processes, given decreasing data capture
costs; and

questioning and inventing new norms of ethical data use.

Qualifications:
Candidates must have a PhD, MDes/MFA, MBA, or equivalent terminal
degree by the appointment start date in visual, interactive,
experience, or information design, and or marketing, management, or
related fields that ensure the ability to transform data into
meaningful experiences. Applicants should have expertise in one or
more areas of design practice or business management, an
outstanding active research record, a research agenda that aligns
with University and College strategic areas, and a willingness to
collaborate across the University.


Preferred Qualifications:
Evidence of a high level of skill and accomplishment across media,
provocative meaning-making, a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility,
and a strong publication and exhibition record is required.
Candidates should have a well-developed research agenda that will
inform and advance current trends in the field and potentially
contribute in unique ways to furthering the reputation of CAMD and
DMSB.

Candidates should have a strong interest in interdisciplinary
collaboration and experience in or a commitment to working with
diverse student populations in a culturally diverse work and
educational environment. Successful applicants will demonstrate
potential for having a national and international record of
excellence in creative practice, innovative research, substantive
scholarship, and effective teaching.

Salary Grade:
Salary will be determined, commensurate with experience.

Additional Information:
All applications must be submitted electronically at https://careers.hrm.northeastern.edu.

research statement that includes a link to a portfolio of research
and professional outcomes, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and

contacted at a later date.

Inquiries may be directed to Associate Professor Ann McDonald,
chair of the search committee, a.mcdonald@northeastern.edu.

Position SummaryThe Nolen Laboratory at the
University of Oregon is currently seeking a full-time Research
Assistant or Associate to study fundamental problems in
cytoskeletal regulation.

A B.S. or more advanced degree in Chemistry, Biochemistry,
Molecular Biology, Genetics, Structural Biology or a related area
and prior experience in a research laboratory are required.
Preference will be given to candidates with advanced degrees and at
least three years of experience in a research laboratory. Because
we approach problems in cytoskeletal function from diverse angles,
the successful candidate could have specific laboratory experience
in any of the following: protein biochemistry, cell biology, x-ray
crystallography, fluorescence microscopy, or molecular biology.
Duties will include: independent research and assisting other lab
members with experiments, general maintenance of laboratory and
equipment.

This research technician position will involve studies of actin
cytoskeleton regulation using biochemical, cell biological,
structural and/or biophysical techniques. The purpose of this
position is to make high impact scientific discoveries in the field
of actin regulation. The essential responsibilities will be to
design and conduct experiments, interpret data, assist and train
other researchers in the laboratory and maintain laboratory
equipment. This position regularly comes in contact with other lab
researchers (students, postdocs, and technicians) and with the
laboratory principle investigator. The scope of interactions of
this position with external, local, national, or international
contacts will be limited or non-existent.

This person will make decisions about how to set up biochemical,
biophysical, structural and cell biological assays. They will also
make decisions about how to troubleshoot experiments that are not
working, how to present data, how to care for equipment and
reagents, how to train other lab members, and how to formulate and
address key questions in actin cytoskeletal biology. The impact of
these decisions will be on the scientific direction of the
laboratory. Further, because the experiments will be published in
scientific journals and funded by the federal government, job-level
decisions will also have impact on the success metrics of the
Chemistry and Biochemistry Department, the Institute of Molecular
Biology, the University of Oregon, the National Institutes of
Health and the federal funding of basic research. The level of
independence in decision-making for this position will depend on
the level of experience. Candidates hired at the level of Research
Associate will participate more heavily in project design and
manuscript and grant preparation compared to Research Assistants.
At a minimum, the technician will meet with the laboratory
principle investigator once per week. The guideline for job-related
decisions will be to maximize scientific impact and experimental
efficiency. The position will report to the laboratory PI. No one
will formally report to this position, though, as stated above, the
person in this position may be asked to train other laboratory
members.

Minimum Requirements
Research Assistant Rank:

Bachelor's degree in biology, biochemistry, or
chemistry.
Experience working in a laboratory that conducts experiments in
cell biology, biochemistry, structural biology or biophysics.

Open Rank Faculty Position in Design

College/School/Unit: College of Fine Arts
Department: School of Design and Creative Technologies
Posted: Dec 14, 2020
Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The Department of Design in the School of Design and
Creative Technologies (SDCT) at The University of Texas at
Austin (UT) seeks two or more open-rank faculty in Design. Tenure
status and rank will be based on candidates' profiles and
experience.

One of our goals as a department is to ensure that design
serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races, ethnicities,
genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic statuses,
nationalities, and linguistic and cultural traditions. Recognizing
that the profession of design as it exists in the United States
today is both a product and a (re)producer of white supremacy,
patriarchy, ableism, and elitism, we invite applications from
academics and practitioners whose teaching, scholarship,
professional practice, creative activity, and/or service disrupts
this tradition. We especially welcome applications from candidates
belonging to groups that have been historically underrepresented in
higher education, including women, racial and ethnic minorities,
LGBTQIA people, and people with disabilities.

As a relatively small program needing to grow in the areas of
interaction, service, graphic, and industrial design, we are less
concerned right now with hiring in any one of these areas of
specialization than in being led by and collaborating with faculty
colleagues whose practice and teaching will help orient the
department toward social justice, inclusion, and equity.

Qualifications

Required Qualifications:
To be considered for this position, you must:

hold a terminal degree in your field by date of hire, OR
possess a record of equivalent professional experience or
scholarly/creative achievement;
have a record of working productively with people of diverse
disciplines, ranks, races, ethnicities, nationalities, gender
identities, sexual orientations, ages, and abilities;
demonstrate a high level of craft in one or more subfields of
design, including expertise with contemporary design processes,
workflows, and relevant software.


Desired Qualifications:
We are particularly interested in candidates who:

can teach UI/UX design, industrial design, graphic design, or
service/experience design;
engage in creative or scholarly work that centers on issues of
race, ethnicity, decoloniality, intersectionality, oppression,
resistance, and/or activism;
have a record of teaching, scholarship, professional practice,
creative activity, and/or service that centers on ensuring that
design serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races,
ethnicities, genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic
statuses, nationalities, and linguistic and cultural
traditions;
have taught both small- and large-enrollment courses;
have taught hybrid and/or online courses.


Responsibilities of this position may
include:

teaching introductory courses in the Design BA, BFA, and MFA
programs and/or MA in Design in Health program (to both design
majors and curious non-majors from engineering, business, computer
science, medicine, and other fields);
developing and teaching introductory through advanced
undergraduate and graduate courses, including thematic/special
topics courses, in your area of specialization;
team-teaching interdisciplinary courses that enroll students
from multiple majors;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate independent
studies;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate final projects,
exhibitions, and/or reports;
writing or revising undergraduate and graduate curricula;
serving on department, school, college, and/or university
committees.


Faculty appointed with tenure or to the tenure track are also
expected to maintain an active agenda of scholarly research,
professional practice, and/or creative work that creates or
sustains their national profile in the field. Non-tenure-track
faculty are encouraged—but not required—to maintain an active
professional practice or scholarly research program.

Application Instructions

To apply for the position, please submit the following to
Interfolio at https://apply.interfolio.com/82052:

A letter of application explaining your qualifications for, and
interest in, the position, including discussion of your most
significant research/creative/professional, teaching, and service
activities in the arena of design for equity, diversity, inclusion,
and/or social justice;
A curriculum vitae (CV) or professional resume;
A link to or pdf of a portfolio of recent design work
Contact information for three references (letters will be
requested only for finalists).


Applications received by January 22, 2021 will be assured a full
review. Applications received after that date will be reviewed as
needed until the position is filled. Due to current travel
restrictions, we expect to conduct all interviews remotely.

Questions about the application process and Interfolio may be
directed to SDCT Executive Assistant Mr. Cameron Weed at cweed@austin.utexas.edu;
questions about the positions themselves may be directed to search
committee chair Prof. Jason Wilkins at jasonwilkins@utexas.edu.

If you are excited about the possibilities of working in the
Department of Design, but don't fit this particular job
description, please see our open call for faculty at https://apply.interfolio.com/79104.

About the Department of Design
The design program at UT, formerly a division of the Department of
Art and Art History, became the Department of Design in 2017 and
combined forces with the recently created Department of Arts and
Entertainment Technologies, the Center for Integrated Design, and
the Design Institute for Health to form the new School of Design
and Creative Technologies (SDCT). The move to SDCT has enabled the
design program to expand its enrollment and course offerings to
meet growing demand from majors and non-majors and to develop
industry partnerships. The department now offers two undergraduate
degrees and two graduate degrees, as well as extensive additional
coursework geared toward students majoring elsewhere on campus who
wish to be more designerly in their approach to their work.

research university of over 50,000 students that is routinely

About the University:
California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in
2002 as the newest campus in the California State University
system. Since that time, the University has grown and developed
into one of the premier public universities, not only in the
California State University system, but also in the nation. Indeed,
U.S. News & World Report listed CSUCI as 20th among “Top Public
Schools” in its 2021 edition of Best Colleges Rankings. In 2020,
CollegeNET also ranked CSUCI 20th out of over 1,449 schools in its
“Social Mobility Index,” and Money Magazine rated CSUCI as the 15th
“Most Transformative College” in the nation.
CSUCI is a public comprehensive university that engages students
in critical inquiry and is dedicated to educating leaders for a
global society. The University is located in Ventura County and is
home to more than 6,900 undergraduate and 239 graduate students.
Approximately 55% of CSUCI’s students are Pell Grant eligible, and
approximately 62% are first-generation college students. CSUCI is
also proud to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution
(HSI), with 55% of its undergraduate students self-identifying as
Latinx, 25% as White, 6% as Asian/Asian American, 4% as
multiracial, and 2% as Black/African American. In 2019, CSUCI was
awarded Excelencia in Education’s inaugural “Seal of Excelencia”
for its facilitation of Latinx student success.
CSUCI is committed to diversifying its faculty in order to
address students’ ever-changing needs in the 21st century. The
University is also taking steps to confront racism and to advocate
for social justice. To this end, CSUCI encourages applicants to
apply who are motivated to serve and contribute to the university’s
tenure-track body, which self-identifies as 62% White, 21% Latinx,

to furthering inclusive excellence in our campus community. We seek
to enhance our diverse University population by welcoming people
from all backgrounds, and by working to sustain an environment
where colleagues can not only work and learn, but also create and

CSUCI Mission Statement:
Placing students at the center of the educational experience,
California State University Channel Islands provides undergraduate
and graduate education that facilitates learning within and across
disciplines through integrative approaches, emphasizes experiential
and service learning, and graduates students with multicultural and
international perspectives.
 
CSUCI’s Commitment to You:
CSUCI is committed to helping newly hired faculty develop a
sense of belonging in a collaborative and supportive community
dedicated to providing resources and opportunities for establishing
and sustaining a research agenda and engaging in continuous
improvement in equitable teaching and learning.
 
About the Program: 
Our university is situated just an hour north of Los Angeles, a
thriving center for art, media, and entertainment, in a picturesque
location between the foot of the Santa Monica Mountains and the
Pacific Ocean.  CSUCI is the newest university of the CSU
system, and as such there are many opportunities for innovative
approaches.  The CSUCI Art Program uniquely combines fine art,
design, digital media, and art history, embracing a
multidisciplinary approach to artistic and creative production. We
are looking for a colleague who can energetically engage students
with technical and conceptual content, and the ideal candidate will
have the ability to bridge traditional and digital media.

The Art Department at CSUCI is vibrant, interdisciplinary, and
forward-looking. There are no ivory towers here (literally or
figuratively), nor does our campus have any ivy-covered brick
buildings (it’s Southern California, and most of the landscaping is
native and drought tolerant). We embrace the offbeat, the unusual,
the civic-minded, the culturally engaged, the active voice, and the
conceptually challenging. 

This hire will be just the sixth full-time studio-based faculty
member in our department, meaning there is room to innovate, to
experiment, and to build out an area in a way that reflects a
greater vision.

A large percentage of our students are the first in their family to
attend college — they’ve made the bold decision to declare “art” as
a major, and we seek to reward them by empowering them, and helping
them to learn tangible skills so they can make a meaningful impact
in the art world and in the creative industry.

Our faculty are relentlessly committed in the classroom, and
equally committed in the pursuit of their practice.  We take
our creative production seriously but we’re not afraid to make the
learning experience enjoyable and fun. 
 
About the Position:
 First and foremost, the ideal candidates
should have a genuine love of the moving image and an interest in
sharing their knowledge, experience, and understanding of 4D media
in a classroom and studio-based environment. This love might span
historical films, world cinema, experimental and avant-garde
pursuits, iconic Hollywood genres and sub-genres, underground film,
the cinema of historically underrepresented groups,
documentary-based explorations, pop culture gifs and memes,
broadcast graphics, title sequences, or anything in
between. 

Specifically, we are seeking a colleague who will mentor students
in the context of upper- and lower-division video courses as well
as courses in time-based imaging and motion graphics.  With
our proximity to Los Angeles, this is an ideal location for a
motivated 4D practitioner, and many of our students seek to be
involved in the wealth of creative fields connected to the
region.

Our department has the tools necessary to make teaching these
classes a positive experience — there are multiple digital labs
equipped with the latest software, as well as a wide array of
dedicated cameras, lighting, and sound equipment. A small 832
square foot sound-proof studio serves well for classroom
explorations.  Additionally, the candidate will be provided
with an equipment budget to further outfit these courses with
additional tools and equipment as necessary.

We invite applications from candidates with diverse research and
unique teaching perspectives based on non-traditional educational
backgrounds or from their personal experiences as members of groups
historically underrepresented in higher education. Candidates whose
work demonstrates a commitment to civically engaged research that
bridges communities across boundaries of difference are encouraged
to apply.
 
Minimum Degree Requirements:
Candidates must have an MFA (or an equivalent terminal degree)
in New/Emerging Media, 4D Practice, Film/Video, (or a closely
related field) by the start of the appointment.
 
Required Qualifications:
Individuals with demonstrated excellence in university-level or
community college-level teaching are encouraged to apply. (Note:
this can also include Teaching Assistant-based experience, or
instances where a graduate student has served as the “instructor of
record.”)
Candidates should be active and practicing in a Film or
Time-Based Media-Related field, with a growing record of creative
work exhibited/displayed/screened in a variety of possible
settings, including: festivals, museums, galleries, alternative
spaces, online venues, and/or other traditional, experimental,
community-based settings.
The submitted portfolio links should demonstrate evidence of
high-level skills related to 4D media, and candidates should
showcase relevant technical know-how. An understanding of
industry-standard equipment, cameras, lighting, and software
(Premiere, Final Cut Pro, and/or After Effects, etc.) is essential.
Candidates should have teaching experience in 4D related fields
including video and/or motion/broadcast graphics. 
                 
                 
            
Applicants should demonstrate the commitment to effectively work
with and engage a diverse student population and evidence of how
they would successfully mentor minoritized students with special
focus on Latinx, Black/African American, American Indian, and
Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander students.
 
Preferred Qualifications:
The Art Department is especially interested in candidates who
are creative, innovative, hands-on, practitioners.  Enthusiasm
and energy are significant for this position, and should also
resonate in a candidate’s submission materials when applying for
this position.  We are excited to hire a colleague who is
interested in collaborating as a core member of a dedicated faculty
with a genuine interest in helping students succeed.

We seek a dynamic individual who is capable as both a conceptual
and technical practitioner – essentially someone who can embrace
experimental artistic production as well as the more commercial
applications of the medium.

Experience working with a wide range of digital cameras, lighting,
and any additional tools (Nuke, DaVinci Resolve, and/or Cinema 4D,
etc.) would be a positive, but more important, we seek candidates
who are driven to continue learning the tools of the trade and
motivated to stay up-to-date for the benefit of creating a positive
classroom experience. Candidates with more expertise in motion
design as opposed to filmmaking, or vice versa, should not be
discouraged from applying, as long as they are enthusiastic about
teaching in both fields.
 
Responsibilities:
A full-time courseload will typically consist of three classes
per semester (approximately 18 units per year). In addition to
teaching, faculty are expected to maintain a
professional/creative/artistic practice; serve on university
committees; advise students; and participate in curriculum
development and other departmental activities.

Specific courses taught by the Assistant Professor of
Film/Time-Based Media would likely include:

Art 212 - Video Production
Art 325 - Digital Media Art: Digital Filmmaking
Art 312 - Digital Media Art: Time-based Imaging
Art 322 - Digital Media Art: Time-based Compositing and Visual
Effects

As the department continues to grow, we foresee opportunities to
expand and diversify courses according to a particular candidate’s
area of research. An interest in teaching a film history course
would also be a positive.

Application Deadline:
Screening of applications will begin 10/4/2021.
Priority will be given to applicants who meet the screening
deadline; however, the position will remain open until filled.
 
Applicants must submit the following
materials: 

Cover Letter
Curriculum Vitae (which includes a record of teaching
experience, courses taught, and creative activities)
Artist’s Statement
Artist’s Biography
Contact Information for Three Professional References
5 to 10 Samples of Student Work
Recent Students Evaluations
Portfolio (Please see important note below)

Note: In the “Portfolio Samples” section of this application,
candidates are encouraged to submit a link to a highlight reel that
provides an overview of their creative work. Please also include
links for 5 to 10 additional full-length samples of work, or as
many samples as necessary in order to best represent your creative
activities. Portfolio materials can take the form of a personal
website, a YouTube channel, a Vimeo page, a PDF consisting of still
images/slides, a Google Drive link, a Behance page, and/or any
other easily accessible media platforms.

Please double-check to ensure that links and the subsequent media
are functional and accessible from a variety of computers.  If
a password is necessary to access online content, please provide
that password, and again, ensure that it is easily accessible.

A statement describing your experience mentoring and/or working
with minoritized students with a special focus on Latinx,
Black/African American, Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander and
American Indian students, and
A teaching philosophy describing how you plan to engage and
interact with students, with a special focus on Latinx,
Black/African American, Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander, and
American Indian students.

 
In later phases of the search process, applicants may be
requested to provide verification of terminal degrees, licenses and
certificates.

and geographical communities. Emerson endorses a framework of
inclusive excellence, which recognizes that institutional
excellence comes from fully engaging with diversity in all aspects
of institutional activities.

The Department of Writing, Literature, and Publishing is a vibrant
and engaged community of scholars, writers, publishers, and
designers with over 100 full- and part-time faculty members, 550
undergraduate majors, and 250 graduate students in its two Creative

Program Description:
Emerson's nationally recognized Writing Studies Program was awarded
the CCCC Writing Program Certificate of Excellence in 2013. The
program provides a required two-course sequence of first-year
writing classes designed to enable undergraduate students to write
competently and effectively in a range of modes. WR101:
Introduction to College Writing focuses on cultural analysis that
appears in academic work and in the public intellectual sphere.
WR121: Research Writing explores how rhetorical situations call on
writers to do research and how writers draw on various types of
writing to present the results of their research. Additional
emphasis is placed on training and mentoring graduate student
instructors, through the pedagogy seminar WR600: Teaching College
Composition, a weekly practicum, and regular professional
development workshops. The Writing Studies Program at Emerson is an

longstanding commitments to community writing and publishing
projects, translingual writing and teaching, and connections

and/or practice. Expertise in translingualism with a readiness to
teach international student-focused course sections as well as
mentor other instructors of those sections, and in Writing Across
the Curriculum/Writing in the Disciplines, will be of particular
interest. Strengths in comparative and inclusive rhetorics,
anti-racist pedagogy, multimodality and digital literacy, community
writing and publishing, and intersections with creative writing or
literary study are also especially suited to the
intellectual/curricular work of the program.

Position Description


The Psychology Department at the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for a tenure-track assistant
professor position in social psychology. We seek to hire a scholar
who views social issues through a structural lens and whose
research advances the unique social justice focus of our program.
We are particularly interested in scholars who can contribute to
our intellectual emphasis on diversity, social policy, and social
change and who utilize intersectional approaches. Possible areas of
specialization include (but are not limited to) race, ethnicity,
and inequality; oppression and privilege; prejudice, stereotyping,
and discrimination; sexual and gender diversity; social and
economic justice movements (including grassroots or collective
action); the social psychology of justice-oriented and criminal
justice policies, practices, and institutions; educational access,
equity, and fairness; social psychological analyses of neoliberal
policies and practices (e.g., gentrification); migration,
immigration, and citizenship; colonialism and decolonization; the
social psychology of health and health disparities; political
psychology; environmental justice; and policy analysis or
assessment (in any content area). Candidates should be actively
engaged in research and show promise of continued research
productivity. In addition, they should be prepared to teach both
graduate and undergraduate level courses in social psychology and
to contribute significantly to graduate education through mentoring
of graduate students. We seek to hire scholars whose strengths best
complement the distinctive character of our social justice oriented
social psychology program and are especially interested in
candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of
our academic community through their research, teaching, and
service. The successful candidate must be able to work with
students, faculty and staff from a wide range of social and
cultural backgrounds. UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic-Serving
Institution with a high proportion of first-in-family undergraduate
students.

We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing women and
minorities who are underrepresented in higher education careers (as
evidenced by life experiences and educational background), and who
have experience in equity and diversity with respect to teaching,
mentoring, research, life experiences, or service towards building
an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.
