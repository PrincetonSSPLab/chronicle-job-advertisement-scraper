Associate or Full Professor and Associate Director
Job Description Summary
Washington State University (WSU) Health Sciences and the
Department of Medical Education and Clinical Sciences of the Elson
S. Floyd College of Medicine invite applications for a dynamic and
engaged Associate or Full Professor passionate about community
health and health equity. This position is a permanent, full-time,
12-month, tenure-track position is administratively in either
Seattle or Spokane, WA. The faculty member’s primary responsibility
will be as the Associate Director of the Northwest Health Education
and Research Outcomes Network (NW HERON), a practice-based research
network (PBRN) housed in the Institute for Research and Education
to Advance Community Health (IREACH). NW HERON explicitly focuses
on rural, tribal, and other underserved communities and the
practices serving them in Washington, and neighboring regions.
PBRNs are groups of primary care providers and practices working
together to address health and health care priorities. Together,
clinicians, patients, and academic researchers in PBRNs nationwide
conduct breakthrough research on solutions to neglected and
unaddressed aspects of primary care, improving the day-to-day
delivery of health care. Successful academic research with PBRN
partnerships requires faculty with the training and experience to
conduct multi-site studies with diverse clinic and community
partners, and who possess a deep personal commitment to advancing
health equity and social justice.

The faculty member will work both on existing programs, grants, and
centers; and will be fully supported to develop new areas of
research aligned with his or her interests and ongoing research,
primarily within the scope of NW HERON. The new hire will receive
support and mentoring as needed to rapidly build connections with
rural and tribal PBRN partners, to collaborate with WSU researchers
and Extension faculty, and to pursue extramural funding to expand
WSU’s rural health research portfolio. The new hire will be
integrated into IREACH, a diverse interdisciplinary group devoted
to promoting health equity and quality health care, particularly in
Native populations.
We seek a scientist with a cutting-edge, theory-informed vision
to shift paradigms and change the status quo in the
context of the mission of a land-grant university. This successful
candidate will, over time, assume responsibilities for and oversee
the scientific, administrative, and fiscal matters within IREACH
with the other faculty co-director. The position will require daily
interactions with all the IREACH units described above. This
individual will need to engage with diverse health care
stakeholders such as farmers, primary care providers, addiction
councilors, and tribal members, to develop innovative strategies
that address and ultimately solve health and health care challenges
faced by rural people. Dispelling the myth that rural residents are
homogeneous and applying an intersectional lens to untangling rural
health disparities will be critical to the success of these
objectives. In addition, because PBRNs are ideal for
group-randomized trials we hope the new hire will have a background
in intervention science and clinical trials; such expertise will
complement the work of clinical trialists and epidemiologists
already engaged in health disparities research within IREACH and
the College of Medicine. Working with NW HERON will be a core
component of the position; equally essential will be engaging with
and capitalizing on opportunities for collaboration offered by the
complementary units across WSU. In short, we are seeking an
extraordinary individual committed to change – a rainmaker – who
can work across communities, academic units, and policymakers.
  
As an integral member of NW HERON and the Department of
Community and Behavioral Health, this individual will galvanize
diverse teams of researchers to address the complex factors
affecting rural, tribal, and minority community health. This effort
will include research with rural clinical and community partners to
rigorously study and test interventions in real-world settings.
Topics include but are not limited to social (e.g., built
environment, health care access, and structural racism), biological
(e.g., genetic and epigenetic factors), and cultural (e.g.,
ceremonial tobacco use, health behaviors associated with rural
migrant lifestyles) determinants of health. Conducting high-quality
science to conclusively identify causes of health inequities and
generate evidence-based solutions is extremely challenging but
essential to achieving authentic health equity for all Americans.
The emphasis on underserved people is both central to WSU’s mission
and feasible given WSU’s statewide outreach and IREACH’s solid
foundation of research with underserved populations. Because NW
HERON is a network of clinical facilities, studies conducted
through NW HERON offer novel opportunities not only to observe but
to directly mitigate rural, racial and ethnic health disparities by
changing on-the-ground practices and by helping to remove
structural barriers that perpetuate inequity.
Publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at
professional societies, and engagement with relevant community
groups is expected. Our faculty typically mentor graduate students,
post-doctoral fellows, and early career faculty. The successful
candidate is expected to contribute to a robust and collaborative
academic life, including participating in College of Medicine and
university committees, and in IREACH service activities. Classroom
teaching is not required or expected but may be negotiated if
desired.
Most of the successful candidate’s time – up to 90% – will be
focused on extramural research. This time can represent a
combination of independent, collaborative, or cross-disciplinary
scholarship through both internal and external grant funding. The
remaining time (up to 20%) comprises grant writing and service. If
mentoring or teaching are undertaken, these activities will be
considered academic service. Travel (up to 50%) is required. IREACH
faculty engage in both on- and off-site work.
Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.
WSU has comprehensive benefits including medical, dental, life, and
long-term disability insurance. We offer excellent retirement
programs and a generous leave program. IREACH is offering a
generous recruitment and start-up package.
Required qualifications include an earned PhD in Public Health,
Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Nursing, Medicine (i.e., an MD), or in
another field relevant to public health research at the time of
hire, and current appointment at the Associate or Professor rank at
an academic institution of higher learning. If an Assistant
Professor, must be in process of being promoted to Associate
Professor and have at least 6 years of experience as a faculty
member. At least 5 years of experience working with underserved
populations, preferably American Indian, Alaska Native, Native
Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or rural populations. Demonstrated
experience conducting research in Native health, rural health,
behavioral health/addictions, health technology, social
determinants of health, environmental health or similar disciplines
aligned with IREACH’s mission. Demonstrated extensive
administrative skills and experience with fiscal and budgetary
matters. Demonstrated high-level organizational and multi-tasking
competencies while also being flexible. Demonstrated ability to
interact with large groups and individuals at all academic and
community levels. Proficiency in the use of computers and software
applications.
For a Professor level, additional requirements include
demonstrated academic and research merit at the Associate Professor
or Professor level including success in securing extramural funding
for research within IREACH’s target populations, as evidenced by
publication record, and in teaching and in service to the
profession.    
Preference is given to applicants that have demonstrated
experience mentoring junior faculty, and/or postdoctoral fellows;
demonstrated experience bringing together community organizations
and academic constituents; demonstrated experience engaging
community organizations in the research process and demonstrated
sensitivity to and desire to promote health equity, inclusion, and
diversity.

focused on extramural research. This time can represent a
combination of independent, collaborative, or cross-disciplinary
scholarship through both internal and external grant funding. The
remaining time (up to 20%) comprises grant writing and service. If
mentoring or teaching are undertaken, these activities will be
considered academic service. Occasional travel (< 10%) is
required. IREACH faculty engage in both on- and off-site work.
Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.
WSU has comprehensive benefits including medical, dental, life, and
long-term disability insurance. We offer excellent retirement
programs and a generous leave program. IREACH is offering a

another field relevant to public health research at the time of
hire, and current appointment at the Assistant or Associate rank at
an academic institution of higher learning. Have at least 5 years

individuals at all work levels. Demonstrated experience writing
successful grant applications. Track record of external research
funding, preferably NIH. Proficiency in the use of computers and
software applications.

The Department of Special Education (SED) was recently ranked the
#1 program offering a degree in special education in the United
States. It is home to three undergraduate teacher preparation
programs and three graduate programs. The Department includes a
blend of accomplished faculty who are recognized for their
high-quality research and publications, as well as for being
well-grounded in experiences as classroom teachers. The Department
includes 16 tenure line faculty and 35 non-tenure line faculty. The

College of Education
Illinois State University has a historic and enduring commitment to
prepare teachers and other school personnel who will be responsive
to the ethical and intellectual demands of a democratic society. To
teach in a democracy is self-consciously to take up the challenge
of improving the ethical and intellectual quality of our societal
dialogue by including in it as many educated voices as possible.
The democratic ideal unites caring and knowing: the more voices we
call into thoughtful dialogue, and the less fettered the mutual
exchange among those voices becomes, the truer our convictions and
conclusions will be. This is the foundation of a democratic
society, and it is why ISU graduates aspire to teach everyone,
especially those on the margins, those who have been or are in
danger of being excluded. This democratic conception of education
informs all aspects of teacher education at Illinois State.
Graduates who are ready to meet the challenges and rewards of
serving students in a democratic society embody the ethical and
intellectual commitments of teaching and learning in order to
realize the democratic ideal. The College of Education complements
its abiding commitment to inclusive teacher preparation and the
development of educational leaders with pursuit of scholarly work.
A distinguished faculty, and the students they mentor, engage in
work that discovers, integrates, and applies disciplinary knowledge
while also advancing the University’s commitment to the scholarship
of teaching and learning.

ISU is ranked as the fourth largest producer of teachers in the
nation. Nearly one in six Illinois public school teachers is an ISU
alum. The College of Education is organized into the Department of
Special Education, the Department of Educational Administration and
Foundations, the School of Teaching and Learning, the Cecilia J.
Lauby Teacher Education Center and two laboratory schools: the
Thomas Metcalf School and University High School. The College
enrolls more than 3,000 students who choose from a wide array of
teacher and administrator preparation programs, including Learning
and Behavior, Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Low Vision and Blindness,
Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education, Middle Level
Education, Reading, Bilingual and Bicultural Education, Leadership,
Equity, and Inquiry, and areas of educational
administration/leadership. Graduate programs are offered in Special

coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The

Department:
Posted: Oct 12, 2021
Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The Graduate Program in Urban Design, at the University of Texas at
Austin, is seeking an accomplished designer and educator to join
the faculty. One who will bring vision, innovative teaching, and
creative research to the program, and the School of Architecture.
The position is a full-time tenure-track appointment with
responsibilities for teaching, research, and service. The
successful candidate will be expected to teach urban design studios
at both the core and at the advanced level. A candidate's ability
to contribute additional teaching through urban design related
courses, and in the candidate's area of research, will be a
significant aspect of the search. Expertise in the areas of
adaptation to climate change, zero-carbon cities, digital
representation, urban morphology, housing and urban development,
landscape infrastructure, public space, and the provision of social
equity and opportunity in the urban environment, will be
prioritized, as will expertise in Latin American urbanism.

The Graduate Program in Urban Design aims to provide the advanced
education of critical thinkers who will design and implement
progressive improvement and change in the cities and towns of
tomorrow. Our graduates are expected to contribute to the formation
of resilient and sustainable urban environments. Central to our
mission is to create and share knowledge for advancing the urban
design discipline through our research, teaching, and service. Our
aim is to help individuals, communities, and societies meet their
fundamental needs and aspirations.

The University of Texas at Austin is one of the largest and most
highly regarded public universities in the United States. The
School of Architecture offers professionally accredited degree
programs in landscape architecture, architecture, community and
regional planning, and interior design. In addition to urban
design, post-professional and research degree programs in
sustainable design, historic preservation, and architectural
history, are also offered. Urban design faculty may also advise
doctoral students through the community and regional planning
program and the architecture program (which includes tracks in
architectural history, historic preservation, and sustainable
design). The school is organized to support interdisciplinary
education and has established strong collaborations and new
initiatives that engage cities in the United States, Latin America,
and Europe. Opportunities for collaboration with Latin American
cities and universities through special programs such as travel
studios, or through important research centers such as the Teresa
Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, are possible. The
school has a leading initiative on race, gender and the American
built environment.

The Graduate Program in Urban Design includes a Master of Science
in Urban Design (MSUD), a dual-degree with a Master of Science in
Community and Regional Planning (MSUD_MSCRP), a graduate
certificate in Housing and Urbanism, and is developing a new
dual-degree initiative with the Master of Landscape Architecture
degree. Opportunities exist to engage in sponsored
interdisciplinary research through the School of Architecture's
Center for Sustainable Development, which coordinates grants and
contracts on a range of topics.

The University of Texas at Austin benefits, as does the School of
Architecture, from the life and engagement of the City of Austin,
linkages to the Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio metropolitan
regions, and the expanded communities of Latin America.

Qualifications

Candidates for this position must have a terminal degree in their
primary discipline, and a professionally accredited degree in at
least one of the allied design fields: architecture, or landscape
architecture. Successful candidates will have the ability to assume
a leadership role in helping to shape the future direction of the
program and professional education in urban design. The program has
particularly strong affiliations with the architecture, landscape
architecture, and community and regional planning programs in the
school, and additional collaborations with the Texas Real Estate
Center in the McCombs School of Business. The program also has
strong relationships with the professional community in Austin,

Assistant and Associate Professor Positions in Clinical
Psychology

Position Category: Faculty
FLSA: Exempt
FTE: .75
Location: Oxnard

University Background:
The mission of California Lutheran University is to educate leaders
for a global society who are strong in character and judgment,
confident in their identity and vocation, and committed to service
and justice. Founded in 1959 in beautiful Ventura County, the
university has an enrollment of about 4,000 undergraduate and
graduate students who come from across the nation and around the
world from a diversity of backgrounds, cultures and faiths. As a
federally recognized Hispanic-Serving Institution, Cal Lutheran is
looking for candidates with a dedication to and success in working
in diverse communities. The university is committed to an inclusive
learning and work environment that values individual differences
and respects each person’s dignity.

Basic Function:
The California Lutheran University Graduate School of Psychology
(GSoP), a secular program that affirms sexual and gender
inclusivity, invites applications for three full-time, tenure-track
positions (two at the rank of Assistant professor and one at the
rank of Associate Professor) in our APA-accredited PsyD Program in
Clinical Psychology beginning in Fall 2022. Applicants must have a
PhD or PsyD in Clinical Psychology at the time of appointment and
must be licensed or able to become licensed as a psychologist in
the State of California within two years of employment. The
successful applicant for this position will be able to demonstrate
outstanding commitment to doctoral teaching and dissertation
research mentorship. The positions are open to applicants with
demonstrated expertise and capacity to teach at least three courses
across either the applied and/or scientific foundations or
psychology. Applied courses include: multicultural psychology,
gender and sexuality, cognitive assessment, personality assessment,
substance abuse, eating disorders, couples and family therapy,
trauma, neuropsychology or forensics. Scientific foundations
courses include: biological aspects of behavior, social psychology,
tests and measurement, quantitative or qualitative research
methods, or statistics. Additional duties include developing a
program of research that engages graduate students, clinical
supervision of doctoral trainees, participating in ongoing program
development within the PsyD program, serving on faculty committees,
and establishing collaborative relationships within the University
and broader community. Because Cal Lutheran is designated as a
Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), applicants who can demonstrate
both a commitment to improving access to higher education and
effective mentoring of students from underrepresented backgrounds
will be particularly competitive. The GSoP has 10 core faculty
members in a School that is comprised of a PsyD program in Clinical
Psychology, Master of Science programs in Clinical Psychology and
Counseling Psychology (MFT emphasis), and two large community
counseling centers that provide low-fee Spanish and English
clinical services (over 10,000 appointments annually). For faculty
interested in research with clinical populations, the clinics
provide individual, couples, family, group, and child services to
community members with mild to moderate mental health issues and
currently offer specialized programs in intimate partner violence,
dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment
therapy. The PsyD program accepts 17 students per cohort and
distinguishes itself by having small classes, a caring faculty and
staff, state of the art facilities and technology, and a rigorous
curriculum designed to train students in accordance with APA's
Profession-wide Competencies. The program is committed to training
students to integrate practice and research, develop competency in
research and scholarship, and appreciate human diversity by serving
the underserved. The PsyD program fully upholds and furthers the
value of diversity as stated by the University and seeks to recruit
and retain faculty, staff, and students from diverse and
under-represented groups. Cal Lutheran has recently become a
Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and McNair Institution, and we
are looking for candidates with a demonstrated commitment to and
success working in diverse, multi-cultural and multi-racial
communities, particularly in mentoring African American, Latino/a,
and Native American students. Cal Lutheran encourages applicants
from all faiths, and advocates for justice and fairness for all
people. Cal Lutheran is an accredited, private, comprehensive
university that engages students in critical inquiry and is
dedicated to educating leaders for a global society. The campus is
located midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, and is home
to more than 2,800 undergraduate and 1,250 graduate students who
come from 35 countries and represent a variety of faiths. 45.2% of
Cal Lutheran students are from underrepresented groups. Applicants
must have a PhD or PsyD in Psychology from a regionally accredited
institution at the time of appointment (ABD applications
accepted).

Under the direction of the Dean and the Program Director, the
Associate Professor is responsible for providing academic
instruction to students for the assigned graduate courses. The
Associate Professor is to serve as an academic advisor to students;
serve on faculty or university committees; and engage in scholarly
activities and/or creative endeavors as outlined in the faculty

The GSoP has 12 core faculty members in a School comprised of a

Clinical Psychology and Counseling Psychology (MFT emphasis), and
two large community counseling centers that provide low-fee Spanish
and English clinical services. The Centers also provide practicum
and clinical research opportunities for PsyD and MFT students who
are supervised by a Clinic Director and 21 licensed clinical
supervisors. The PsyD program, which has adopted a
practitioner-scholar model, accepts 15 students per cohort and
offers emphases in areas such as forensics, Latino/a psychology,
dialectical behavior therapy, and intimate partner violence. The
School distinguishes itself by having small classes, a caring
faculty and staff, state of the art facilities and technology, and

Summary
The Psychology Department at Washington & Jefferson College
W&J invites applications for a tenure-track assistant professor
position with a specialty area in biological psychology,
physiological psychology, behavioral neuroscience, or related field
beginning July 1, 2022. We seek candidates whose teaching takes an
interdisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on empirical methods.
The successful candidate will actively engage in scholarly activity
with students, academic advising, service and departmental
citizenship. Applicants should possess or be close to completing a
doctorate degree. For a more experienced candidate, a shortened
tenure clock may be possible.
The Psychology Department participates in a wide range of
interdisciplinary programs including Neuroscience, Human Resource
Management, Gender and Women's Studies, Forensic Science, Conflict
and Resolution Studies, and Child Development and Education. Our
teaching generally takes an interdisciplinary approach to the mind,
brain, or human experience, with an emphasis on empirical methods.
The successful candidates will be expected to teach introductory
psychology and neuroscience courses, and a capstone research
laboratory course suitable for both Psychology and Neuroscience
Majors.
 
In addition to teaching introductory psychology courses and
upper level courses in their area of specialty, the successful
candidate will have the opportunity to develop courses around
interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary interests and to contribute
to the First Year Seminar program and other interdisciplinary
programs at the college.
Over time, the successful candidate will actively engage in
academic advising, service, and departmental citizenship as we work
together to advance the college's mission. However, we value the
time, effort, and energy it will take to adjust to campus and the
tenure-track role. We protect our first-year faculty's time by
requiring no advising duties nor committee work during your first
year here. In addition, we have been successful at having only a
single new course preparation a semester for first year faculty. We
also share our course syllabi, activities, and materials as you
develop your courses. Teaching, like other skills, can always be
improved, which is why we include peer observations as part of our
mentoring process for new faculty members. In addition to offering
constructive feedback to the faculty member being observed, the
observer inevitably discovers at least one new idea to try in their
own classes. We grow in our teaching through collaboration and
idea-sharing, and we will ensure that you are well supported to
succeed in teaching our increasingly diverse undergraduate student
population.
Our community matters here. That is why all first-year faculty
are paired with a faculty mentor external to the department, so
that you can both meet more of our wonderful colleagues and expand
your community from day one. We value the interdisciplinary aspect
that comes with a liberal arts education; learning the perspectives
and experiences from your colleagues in other departments can only
serve to make you a better professor.
We have some start-up grant availability and lab space to
continue your research and scholarly activity that involve the
hands-on inclusion of undergraduate students. Opportunities to
include undergraduate students in your research is rewarded through
guided research courses PSY-315. Whether your work is theoretical,
basic, or applied science, critical or mainstream, whether you
publish in academic journals or software packages, we value the
diversity of scholarship within our faculty, and will work to
reward all of your labor. There are a multitude of ways to excel as
a professor here at W&J, and the process of research is just as
important as the product of said research.
At Washington & Jefferson College, we are constantly working
to ensure that diversity and inclusion are valued and acknowledged
on our campus. Our most recent strategic plan 2021-2026 includes
the priority of becoming a more welcoming, inclusive, and visibly
diverse community each year, and we welcome applications from
candidates who would help us fulfill this goal. Faculty in our
department are part of the Pennsylvania Psychological Association's
Task Force on Diversity and are working with the Inclusion,
Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility subcommittee in Faculty
Governance. The subcommittee continues to offer workshops through
the 2021 year, including topics on teaching pedagogy and
de-colonizing our syllabi.
We are seeking a colleague who shares our commitment to
diversity and who brings their own perspective to our collective
efforts to teach and mentor young people from a variety of personal
experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from differences of
culture and circumstance. Pursuant to the College's vision for
cultivating an inclusive community, the search committee asks all
applicants to address in their teaching statement how their past
and/or potential contributions might serve to build W&J's
commitment to teaching and mentoring our growing diverse
population; how their experience and interests blends with
interdisciplinary areas of study; and the type of courses they
might teach as a first-year seminar to help introduce students to
the liberal arts.

Texas Tech University is the flagship of the Texas Tech
University System and a Carnegie Tier One research university. The
current enrollment is nearly 40,000 students. As a federally
designated Hispanic Serving Institution, Texas Tech University
seeks to foster an environment that promotes inclusive access and
attracts committed and high-achieving students. We are dedicated to
recruiting and retaining a diverse group of faculty to educate and
empower our diverse student body while also serving an extremely
vast and diverse state with an increasingly culturally pluralistic
population. The university has also been awarded the Paul Simon
Award for Comprehensive Internationalization by NAFSA: Association
of International Educators twice in the last four years.
 
Lubbock, Texas (Pop. 260,000) is an outstanding place to live
and work. This growing city, with its college-town feel, has a
remarkable history and a vital future. Lubbock is the commercial,
agricultural, medical, financial and cultural hub of the South
Plains. The City of Lubbock and Texas Tech University enjoy an
exceptionally cooperative and supportive relationship extending
from community health to cotton crop production, from wind energy
to education. Lubbock is nationally recognized as an outstanding
place to raise a family, and offers ease of access for commuting
across town, or travel across the nation. Depending on one’s
personal preferences, there are plenty of recreational
opportunities and a wide variety of restaurants and shopping,
community events and cultural activities including breweries and
wine bars, a vibrant live-music scene, along with more traditional
performing arts. 
 
The Texas Tech University College of Education,
with over 2,000 students, offers a nationally recognized
undergraduate teacher preparation program, and 21 graduate degrees
that prepare students for professional or academic positions in
education. The department and college place a focus on strategic
outreach and engaged scholarship. We collaborate with local,
regional, state, national and global partners to address complex
problems facing individuals and communities. In recognition of its
extraordinary community outreach efforts, the college received a
2018 W.K. Kellogg Foundation Community Engagement Scholarship Award

The Department of Curriculum and Instruction offers a
competitive graduate program that is growing both nationally and

education and serving EC-12 public schools and beyond.
 
Our 
Bilingual Education and ESL Master’s program plays an important
role in Texas Tech’s strategic area of education and empowerment of
our diverse student body and needs faculty who will contribute to
the advancement of this goal. Due to the fact that Texas has almost
one million English language learners and approximately 85% of them
are Hispanics, 90% of the students in the program are coming from
the teaching force related to Spanish-English dual language
programs. We are therefore seeking highly qualified applicants who
have expertise in Bilingual Education as well as native or near
native fluency in Spanish that will enable them to meet the
instructional demands.
 
In consonance with the mission of the National Association for
Bilingual Education, the program also strives to prepare students
to advocate for educational equity and excellence for culturally
and linguistically diverse students and seeks candidates who have
the expertise to provide the appropriate training in Bilingual
Education policy and advocacy.
 
Applicants should be committed to collaborating with faculty
across the disciplines to engage in rigorous and theoretically
grounded research approaches for understanding and improving the
educational experiences of bilingual students and emergent
bilinguals in the United States. This aligns with the mission of
Texas Tech University as a Hispanic Serving Institution. Candidates
from underrepresented groups in higher education faculty with

Environmental Science, Policy & Management

The Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management
(ESPM) at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) invites
applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor nine-month
faculty position in the area of Physical Environmental
Science.

ESPM is a multidisciplinary community of scholars and Cooperative
Extension Specialists from the biological, physical, and social
sciences and the humanities who conduct research, teaching, and
outreach to advance scientific understanding and develop solutions
for the world's pressing environmental problems. Home to a
top-ranked Ph.D. program in environmental science, environmental
studies and ecological/evolutionary biology. Our undergraduate
students have a choice of vibrant majors that span the disciplines
in the department. Our excellence can only be fully realized by
faculty, students, and staff who share our commitment to these
values. Successful candidates for our faculty position will
demonstrate evidence of a commitment to equity and inclusion
through their research, teaching, and/or service.

We value diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as exemplified by
the following principles of community: we accept the intrinsic
relationship between diversity and excellence in all our endeavors;
we embrace open and equitable access to opportunities for learning
and development as our obligation and goal. ESPM recognizes that
DEI must be integrated with strategies that address the critical
environmental challenges facing humanity, including climate change,
food security, natural resource access and management,
biodiversity, environmental health, land use decision-making, and
maintaining sustainable living conditions. Financial and in-kind
resources are available to pursue activities that help accelerate
our efforts to achieve our equity and inclusion goals.

Understanding how natural ecosystems respond to environmental
changes, such as changes in temperature and rainfall patterns,
accelerated soil losses, and shifts in land cover/land is
fundamental to solving environmental problems. How to both quantify
these changes, remediate, and adapt to them, requires sophisticated
systems-based research involving physical sciences.

We seek applicants whose work addresses specific aspects of the
physical environment, including (but not limited to) environmental
climatology, hydrometeorology, soil science, land surface
processes, geochemistry, water resources, or complex environmental
systems. We encourage applicants whose research contributes to an
integrated understanding of physical and ecological processes and
looks at the role of the physical environment in ecosystem dynamics
through field, laboratory, and/or theoretical and modeling
approaches.

ESPM is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty,
including dual career couples and single parents. We are also
interested in candidates who have had non-traditional career paths,
who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved

Ballet Company, returned to his home state in 1951 and founded one
of the first ballet programs in an American university. In 2016,
our internationally-acclaimed and NASD-accredited programs in
Ballet and Modern Dance united to form the School of Dance-
retaining the distinctiveness of each discipline, while creating

state-of-the-art facility that includes a 333-seat professional
theatre, a black box theatre space, six large dance studios, one
rehearsal studio, a costume shop, a private faculty studio, and a

FACULTY VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT
Brooklyn College, a senior College of the City University of New
York (CUNY), invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track
faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor in the
Department of Africana Studies within the School of Humanities and
Social Sciences with a starting date in August 2022.
 
We are seeking a Social Scientist who specializes in Caribbean
Studies and Politics with a preference for a scholar who uses
quantitative research methods to teach courses about the Caribbean
and its Diaspora at the introductory and advanced/upper levels, as
well as related General Education department and college-wide
courses. Working within Africana Studies, and in conjunction with
the Caribbean Studies Program, teaching responsibilities of this
position include Caribbean political systems and a range of courses
that speak to the Caribbean diaspora and political institutions.
Other courses could include the following: identity and society,
immigration, climate change/environmental justice and urban
society. These courses will be cross listed with the appropriate
department/s.
 
The Africana Studies Department is committed to in depth
treatments of Africa and its diasporas in the United States, the
Caribbean and Latin America. As one of the oldest Africana
departments in the country, it is also one of the first to move
from the African American Studies model to a more global diasporic
curriculum that is now the standard among such departments. We are
currently the only department in the Social Sciences that offers a
substantial number of courses in Caribbean societies and
politics.
 
We are seeking a candidate who is committed to enhancing a
global perspective and invested in maximizing the academic utility
of our location, establishing greater rootedness in ""place,"" and
builds upon the experiences of our students. The borough of
Brooklyn hosts the largest Caribbean population outside of the
Caribbean basin, and a large portion of Brooklyn College’s students
are of Caribbean origin or descent. We would hope that the
instructor would take into account the academic utility of the rich
social, political, and cultural context of our location in
Brooklyn, while building on the interests of our students, the
largest number of whom (both double majors and students taking our
courses as electives) have majors in the Social Sciences,
Education, and Business respectively.
 
The School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), sitting at
the heart of a great urban college, educates students to be leaders
of character, wisdom, and influence in an interdependent, global
society through high quality humanities and social science
programs. The School of Humanities and Social Sciences is the
intellectual hub of Brooklyn College. HSS empowers
interdisciplinary team-based problem solving, rooted in rigorous
disciplinary training. We foster collaborative engagement among
faculty, students, and communities, in the co-creation of
knowledge. Our students build skills in critical thinking, creative
expression, data analysis, and the capacity to articulate
evidence-based decisions. HSS prepares students to be adaptive and
resilient in a rapidly changing global economy, and to be effective
publicly engaged citizens in a rapidly changing society.
 
Brooklyn College serves students from over 150 countries who
speak over 100 languages and dialects and thus constitutes a
vibrant microcosm of the rich diversity and energy that
characterizes the borough of Brooklyn and the greater New York City
area itself. Its mission features “a special commitment to educate
immigrant and first-generation college students from the diverse
communities that make up our city and state.” The college ethos is
invested in the educational and eventual career success of all of
its students. We are committed to fostering a spirit of camaraderie
and shared ideals across the entire spectrum of our varied
constituency. By accessing a first-class and affordable college
education in an inclusive and nurturing intellectual milieu, our
students acquire the skills, confidence, and global mindedness that
allow them to thrive in a rapidly changing, unpredictable
marketplace of ideas that is increasingly mindless of borders and
spans the gamut of cultures and vernaculars.
 
Our search is one in a college-wide cluster hire of faculty with
a research focus on race, ethnicity and racial justice. Brooklyn
College seeks faculty who are eager to engage with the diversity of
our student body and have a demonstrated commitment to inclusion
and heterogeneity through teaching, research and/or service. We
seek to recruit and retain faculty from historically
underrepresented groups who reflect the mosaic of our student
population. Successful candidates will bring their unique
creativity, sensitivity, insights and perspectives to a community
that welcomes innovation in scholarship and teaching. Together we
will model the finest that a public urban liberal arts, sciences,
and professional studies college can be for the present and
future.

Teach existing undergraduate courses cross-listed courses in
Caribbean Studies, Political Science and general education
courses.

focus.

the Social Sciences area, to begin in the Fall semester of academic
year 2022-23. Applicants of any rank working within Social Sciences
are invited to apply, and we especially welcome applications at the

one or more Postdoctoral Fellows. The IUPRA director will be
expected to teach one undergraduate or graduate course each fall

African Diaspora Studies Department (AADS), the John L. Warfield
Center for African and African American Studies (WCAAAS), and Art
Galleries at Black Studies (AGBS). IUPRA conducts and promotes the

the multiple structural inequalities that impact the lives of
African Americans (and other Black diasporic communities). The
Director reports to the AADS Chair and collaborates with the other
Black Studies units.

The director of IUPRA will work with various legislative officials,
organizations, and community stakeholders to identify issues of

University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, Washington invites
applications for three full-time tenure-track Assistant
Professors (100% FTE, 9-month appointments) working in the
area of climate adaptation. The positions are
anticipated to start in September 2022; negotiable within
reasonable bounds. We seek to form a diverse and inclusive faculty
cohort that will advance and transform the research, teaching, and
community engagement within SEFS and across the allied disciplines
and scholars within the College of the Environment, the UW, and the
multiple communities that we serve.
 
Climate adaptation science is rapidly evolving. The field spans
natural and social science disciplines and is focused on
identifying historical, contemporary, and future approaches to
guiding natural and human systems to adapt to ongoing and projected
climate impacts.  Designing effective, socially just, and
equitable climate adaptation strategies requires a deep
understanding of physical, ecological, social, and biological
implications of climate change, and the inequities it creates.
Cultural and social priorities must be considered within adaptive
strategies to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the
lands in which people live, work and play.   These
positions will work on creative, sustainable, and adaptive
solutions to the multi-dimensional challenges of climate change
through collaborative and convergent research, teaching, and
service in alignment with the SEFS mission, vision and commitment
to Diversity Equity
and Inclusion (DEI). In partnership with all SEFS faculty,
staff and students, they will fully support and advance our
commitments to equity, inclusion, and access work, including
diversification of our curricula, faculty expertise, and
School-wide programming,and perform research that incorporates
transdisciplinary approaches, Indigenous perspectives, engagement
with stakeholders and underrepresented communities, and social
justice and equity implications. Scholars who do not see themselves
historically represented in academia are especially encouraged to
apply.
 
These positions will pursue high-quality, impactful, and
inclusive research, teaching, and engagement on social, natural,
and/or engineered systems, in environments and communities ranging
across a gradient of human population density and development. They
may specialize in one or more of the following themes (listed in
alphabetical order):
 
Chemical Engineering: Chemical Engineers who
develop processes utilizing bio-based resources, such as waste
biomass, and biomass used for ecosystem services and/or for
restoration purposes, to produce valuable, environmentally
responsible products, that provide multiple societal benefits for
climate adaptation such as infrastructure growth in economically
impoverished areas and living wage employment opportunities.
 
Data Science and Discovery: Data scientists who
ask novel questions within the fields of
physical/biological/social/economic sciences and integrate big
datasets (e.g., remote sensing, crowd-sourced, field observations
including forest inventory) to pioneer data exploration,
visualization, data-driven decision making, and modeling to develop
innovative solutions to climate adaptation challenges.
 
Ecological Restoration and Management: Scholars
engaged in ecological restoration, management, and/or social
science who develop innovative methods for effectively, efficiently
and equitably designing and managing terrestrial ecosystems (e.g.
forest, urban) that are diverse, resilient, and adaptive to climate
change while mitigating its impacts on human and natural
systems.
 
Ecosystem Science and Management: Ecosystem
scientists who apply modelling, field-based investigations,
laboratory and/or greenhouse experimentation to identify mechanisms
and controls of ecosystem function, dynamics and drivers of change,
resilience, and adaptation to climate impacts.
 
Environmental Governance: Scholars who examine
interactions among societal actors and institutions (within and
across public and private sectors, civil society, and the
citizenry) aimed at securing collective interests surrounding
climate change and adaptation, or who explore how new environmental
governance arrangements may be directed towards climate change and
adaptation across local to global scales.
 
Environmental Social Science: Scholars trained
in indigenous studies, sociology, anthropology, ethnic studies,
geography, or other related disciplines who examine the
anthropogenic influences driving climate change and climate
adaptation, or who investigate how people, including Indigenous
communities, engage with the political and cultural conditions that
influence ideas and tensions about land, geography, and nature.
 
Responsibilities: All UW faculty engage in
teaching, research, and service. Selected scholars will be expected
to establish and/or maintain an active agenda of scholarly pursuits
including, but not limited to, externally supported research and
creative and/or professionally-associated practice. The selected
scholars will teach departmental and interdepartmental courses,
with the potential to teach at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels. Assigned classes may include lectures, seminars, and
studios, and the opportunity to teach new and innovative courses
related to climate adaptation. Additional responsibilities include
student mentoring of both undergraduate and graduate students, and
departmental or College level service.
 
Qualifications: Applicants must hold a Ph.D. or
foreign equivalent in a field related to climate change adaptation
research, including but not limited to: Chemical Engineering, Data
Sciences, Ecology, Environmental Sciences, Forest Resources, Social
Sciences, or other relevant fields.  Applicants must
demonstrate potential for an academic career at a
national/international level with an active program of research and
teaching, and a record of work related to issues of social justice
and DEI.

About the UCR School of Public Policy
Established in 2012, the UCR School of Public Policy is one of
only four public policy schools in the 10-campus UC system. It is
home to the only Master of Public Policy (MPP) program offered by a
major research university in inland Southern California, as well as
the only public policy school with an undergraduate public policy
major in the entire University of California system; and we will be
launching the first public policy five yar BA-MPP program in the UC
system Fall 2022.
 
At the UCR School of Public Policy, our motto is “Solutions for
the Region, Solutions for the World.” While our research has global
implications and relevance, Southern California—particularly, the
inland region in Southern California— offers us a ""living
laboratory"" in our own backyard to explore, investigate, and learn.
As such, the theories that we test, issues that we analyze, and the
solutions that we identify that concern Southern California and the
Inland Empire's most pressing policy challenges have relevance to
the state, nation, and world. By engaging in research that
identifies the drivers of policy successes, as well as policy
failures, we offer decision-makers, students, and society a more
complete understanding of what works, what doesn’t, and why.
 
Our mission is to train a new generation of forward-thinking
public policy leaders equipped to address the complex, interrelated
challenges of poverty, disease, illiteracy, climate change, energy
security, pollution and more. Their training is informed by (i) a
diverse, interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes
evidence-based policy research as well as cross-learning from both
international and domestic problem-solving experiences, and (ii) a
rich internship program that emphasizes experiential learning.
 
The School is located on the campus of UCR, which is a
world-class research university with an exceptionally diverse
undergraduate student body. Its mission is explicitly linked to
providing routes to educational success for underrepresented and
first-generation college students. A commitment to this mission is
a preferred qualification.

strong sense of community and
support within the Department, and we offer a solid foundation

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES:
Stetson’s College of Arts and Sciences (http://www.stetson.edu/portal/artsci/)

includes the humanities, social sciences,
natural sciences, education, and creative arts. With nineteen
academic departments and nine

the College is its faculty of approximately 140 full-time
teacher-scholars. The College offers 31
undergraduate majors and 34 undergraduate minors; six graduate
degrees are offered in
Education, Counselor Education, and Creative Writing. Every
undergraduate major requires a
senior research project, giving students the opportunity to
design and carry out independent
research under faculty mentorship. Our academic programs are
shaped by the values of social
justice and civic responsibility. All of our courses and
programs of study promote engaged learning,
whereby students create connections between the classroom or lab
and the local, regional, and
global community. The academic programs of the College of Arts
and Sciences prepare students to
live significant lives, interact with and positively affect the
world around them.

University’s graduate programs include Business, Accounting,
Educational Leadership, Counseling,
and Creative Writing. Florida’s oldest private institution of
higher learning, Stetson has regularly
been ranked among the best regional universities in the
Southeast and was the first private college
in Florida to be granted a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.
Stetson University provides an inspiring education that engages
students with rigorous academic
and creative study grounded in liberal learning and promotes
civic values of personal and social
responsibility. Working closely with faculty and with one
another, students cultivate abilities to

About the School of Social Work The School of
Social Work was established in 2018 as an independent School and is
under the leadership of Founding Dean Dr. Luis R. Torres. The
Department of Social Work has existed since the 1970s, most
recently as part of the Provost, Academic Affairs division. The
University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) School of Social Work
(SSW) is the only institution to offer programs leading to both the
Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree and the Master of Science in
Social Work (MSSW) degree south of San Antonio. Both programs are
accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). CSWE-COA
voted to reaffirm the accreditation of the program for eight years,
which extends through February 2023. The BSW Program prepares
students for generalist social work practice. Building on the
generalist foundation, the MSSW program focuses on two
concentrations: Direct Practice with Latino Individuals, Families,
and Groups; and Community Practice and Administration. Its goals
are to prepare graduates to practice with diverse, vulnerable, and
at-risk populations to promote human well-being and social and
economic justice, especially in the Texas-Mexico border region; to
prepare graduates for leadership in developing and implementing
policies and services for at-risk populations with an emphasis on
the Texas-Mexico border region; and to develop the knowledge base
of the social work profession, particularly as it relates to
addressing the needs of at-risk populations with an emphasis on the
Texas-Mexico border region. We offer all MSSW programs in two
modalities, traditional on-campus and online. A PhD in Social Work
is in the planning stages. The School of Social Work is committed
to preparing generalist and advanced professional social workers to
meet the needs of a binational and multicultural community. The
educational emphasis is on social work practice with Latinos
considering multicultural competence, ethical practice, knowledge
building, and social services that promote social and economic
justice.
