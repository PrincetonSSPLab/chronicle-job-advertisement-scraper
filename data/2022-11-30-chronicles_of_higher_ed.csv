The Opportunity
Travel and tourism is the largest industry and economic lifeblood of Central Florida – the area hosts more than 72 million visitors each year. Given the scope and continued growth of the travel industry, Orlando has the opportunity to become the global capital for travel and tourism research, with the University of Central Florida (UCF) assuming a leadership role in this development. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown in stark relief the vulnerability of our travel and tourism industry to various health and safety threats.
The UCF Strategic Investment Program has recently invested $4.5 million dollars in funding for the Infectious Disease and Travel Health Initiative (IDTHI). These funds will be used to hire new faculty across four colleges at UCF (e.g., Hospitality Management; Biomedical Sciences; Engineering and Computer Science; Medicine) with diverse disciplinary and methodological approaches to research on Travel and Infectious Diseases. It is expected that the new and existing faculty will provide a critical mass of investigators whose research collaborations will benefit from the interdisciplinary research and the cross-pollination of different areas of expertise and result in innovative team science that will be well-positioned to obtain external funding.
As part of the Infectious Disease and Travel Health Initiative, the UCF Rosen College of Hospitality Management (RCHM) seeks applicants for a 9-month, full-time, tenure-earning assistant professor position based on experience and qualifications in travel and tourism. We welcome candidates from different academic disciplines and methodological approaches to understand the transmission of infectious diseases through travel and tourism.
The selected candidate will engage in community and industry relations research addressing the behavior and attitudes of individuals, groups, and industries in infectious disease settings.
The incumbent will develop and teach undergraduate and graduate courses at RCHM as well as participate in university, college, and department committees; maintain liaisons with community groups and industry partners; establish a strong research program and actively publish in appropriate journals; and actively seek grant funding.
Minimum Qualifications:
Candidates must have a Ph.D. from an accredited institution in hospitality and travel psychology, education, economics, business, or a related field at the time of appointment, and expertise in cognitive and learning sciences. Candidates must also have grant writing experience, with a focus on business and community resilience and travel research and examination of experience in virtual conditions, allowing deeper and more detailed analyses of complex embodied states.
Preferred Qualifications:
Expertise in grant writing, design experiments, community resilience, communication and collaboration, travel health, and individual adaptation showing potential of research resulting in publications in highly rated journals.
