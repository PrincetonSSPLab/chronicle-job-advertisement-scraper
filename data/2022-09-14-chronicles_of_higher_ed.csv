Hispanic Serving Institution Initiative Tenure Track Assistant
Professor Joint in Society and Genetics and Integrative Biology and
Physiology

POSITION DESCRIPTION
UCLA's Institute for Society and Genetics (ISG) and Department of
Integrative Biology and Physiology (IBP) are jointly recruiting a
tenure-track Assistant Professor faculty member to have a split
appointment in both departments. We are looking for a scholar 1)
whose research addresses fundamental physiological, cellular,
and/or molecular processes in a way that integrates (or plans to
integrate) social or societal dimensions and 2) who can
successfully mentor Latinx undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students and trainees.

Candidates may come from any biological discipline (including
biological anthropology or public health). Research field,
physiological system, and methodological approach (e.g., wet lab,
model systems, computational) are open as well. Preference will be
given to scholars who creatively articulate how their current or
future research engages physiological mechanisms that integrate the
biological (e.g., DNA repair, epigenetics, cellular dynamics,
circadian rhythm, hormonal signaling, microbiome, or metabolic
integrity) and the social or societal (e.g., touch, care, kinship,
networks, foodways, pollution, housing, migration, or
displacement). Special consideration will be given to scholars
whose research also intersects questions of health, wellbeing,
and/or disease affecting Latinx individuals or communities
including indigenous and Black Latinx populations especially in the
USA.

The Institute for Society and Genetics (https://socgen.ucla.edu/) is a
multidisciplinary department of social scientists, life scientists,
and humanists analyzing complex problems at the interface of
biology and society and training crossdisciplinary thinkers. The
Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology (https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/) employs
experimental, computational, and quantitative approaches to study
diverse physiological systems, this has enabled discoveries of how
molecules, cells, tissues, and organisms solve biological problems
essential for life. Successful candidates should be able to
articulate their research and mentoring in ways that contribute to
both scholarly communities.

This search reflects the UCLA Division of Life Science's commitment
to diversify scientific research and training and to support a new
generation of underrepresented minority scholars and trainees
(especially from Latinx, Black, and Native American backgrounds).
UCLA aims to achieve federal designation as a Hispanic Serving
Institution by 2025. In preparation for this designation, the
Office of the Chancellor and the Executive Vice Chancellor and
Provost have sponsored this search in order to recruit exceptional
scholars whose teaching, scholarship and/or mentoring has strong
ties to Latinx experiences in the United States. This search is
conducted in partnership between the Chicano Studies Research
Center and three units in the Life Sciences Division—the Institute
for Society and Genetics (ISG), the Department of Integrative
Biology and Physiology (IBP), and the undergraduate Neuroscience
IDP (uNSIDP). Faculty hired through this search are expected to
maintain an active affiliation to the Chicano Studies Research
Center and encourage the success of Latinx and first-generation
scholars. The HSI initiative prioritizes the hiring of exceptional
scholars who have connections to Latinx experiences in the USA
through their research, teaching, and/or mentoring.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in any relevant
discipline. To apply, access the recruitment via this direct link
https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/JPF07777
on the UCLA Academic Recruit website. The following materials are
required: 1) a cover letter introducing the candidate and
articulating a vision for research, teaching, and mentorship at the
intersection of biology and society, 2) full curriculum vitae; 3) a
description of research plans (2-3 pages); 4) a statement on
teaching and mentoring (1-2 pages); 5) a statement on contributions
to equity, diversity, and inclusion (1-2 pages); 6) three letters
of reference. Initial review of applications will begin on October
17, 2022 and continue until the position is filled. We highly
encourage applications from women, underrepresented minorities, and
individuals with a commitment to mentoring underrepresented groups
in the sciences.

Finalists will be invited to present their research at a 2-day
symposium at UCLA on December 12 and 13, 2022.

The University of California is committed to creating and
maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application,
