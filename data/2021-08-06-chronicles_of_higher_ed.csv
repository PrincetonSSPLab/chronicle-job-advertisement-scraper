The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and
Preservation (GSAPP) at Columbia University invites applications
for two full‐time,
open‐rank faculty positions in
Urban Planning in the tenured,
tenure‐track, and professional
practice categories. A Master’s degree in Urban Planning
or a closely related field (e.g., City and Regional Planning, Urban
Design) is required.
 
GSAPP is a school dedicated to engaging and shaping the local
and global built environment in light of the urgent issues of our
time, such as climate, equity, and emerging technologies. With
Master’s programs in Architecture, Planning, Preservation, Real
Estate Development, Urban Design, and Curatorial Studies, and
Computational Design Practices and doctoral programs in
Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, GSAPP represents a unique
environment that fosters thinking and innovation across scales and
contexts, creating new forms of knowledge and practice. Located in
the heart of New York City, the School has built its long legacy of
excellence as an “urban condenser of ideas,” combining creative
experimentation and unbridled imagination with disciplinary
practice and incisive critical thinking. The Urban Planning program
is one of the oldest in the nation, granting its first degrees in
1941, and has approximately 100 Master’s and 20 Ph.D. students. The
Program’s mission is to prepare our students for societal and
technological changes and to become visionary thinkers and change
makers who are committed to the pursuit of equity and social
justice in and through the built environment.
 
Open to candidates across many urban planning fields, GSAPP is
particularly interested in candidates who teach and conduct
research on issues related to the built environment such as
land use and infrastructure, public health and social justice, or
community development and housing. The ideal candidate will bridge
theory, research, and/or practice to meet pressing challenges
related to antiracism, climate change, socioeconomic disparities,
or transnational flows. Candidates in all ranks and
categories will show clear evidence of expertise and have strong
institution‐building and communication skills. They must have
demonstrated capacity for original work and show promise of
significant continuing contributions to the discipline. All
candidates should have interest in and capacity for collaboration
with other disciplines.
 
GSAPP faculty innovate their disciplines and enable students to
be educated in current and past ideas and methods, as well as
support students’ explorations and testing of new ideas. Therefore,
we welcome applications from candidates who are able to teach,
conduct research, and/or practice in emergent directions. We also
welcome applicants with strong methodological capabilities in the
form of spatial analysis, visualization, data science or new
qualitative design methods.
 
Successful senior candidates (associate professor or full
professor rank) being considered for hire with tenure require
extensive teaching experience, a substantial body of scholarship
and research, and interest in broader public engagement. A strong
commitment to integrate theory and practice is desirable.
 
Tenure‐track candidates in the assistant professor rank must
show evidence of teaching and great promise in scholarship,
research, and/or practice. Tenure-track candidates in the associate
professor rank will have a demonstrated record of teaching,
scholarly achievement, and show great promise of attaining
distinction in their field of specialization. 
 
Successful professional practice candidates (associate professor
of professional practice or full professor of professional practice
rank) must show evidence of recent (within the past 3 years) or
current contributions to the fields of the built environment
through professional engagement and are expected to sustain an
active professional practice. All professional practice candidates
are expected to articulate how their professional expertise and
practice interests can contribute to GSAPP, as a means to shape the
direction of the disciplines and programs of the School as well as
the field more broadly. Candidates for the full professor of
professional practice rank will be those who have a minimum of ten
years’ experience and who have distinguished careers for which they
are recognized at the national and/or international level.
Candidates for the associate professor of professional practice
rank will generally have five years of professional experience and
show clear evidence of expertise and significant promise of
continuing development.

Open Rank Faculty Position in Design

College/School/Unit: College of Fine Arts
Department: School of Design and Creative Technologies
Posted: Dec 14, 2020
Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The Department of Design in the School of Design and
Creative Technologies (SDCT) at The University of Texas at
Austin (UT) seeks two or more open-rank faculty in Design. Tenure
status and rank will be based on candidates' profiles and
experience.

One of our goals as a department is to ensure that design
serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races, ethnicities,
genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic statuses,
nationalities, and linguistic and cultural traditions. Recognizing
that the profession of design as it exists in the United States
today is both a product and a (re)producer of white supremacy,
patriarchy, ableism, and elitism, we invite applications from
academics and practitioners whose teaching, scholarship,
professional practice, creative activity, and/or service disrupts
this tradition. We especially welcome applications from candidates
belonging to groups that have been historically underrepresented in
higher education, including women, racial and ethnic minorities,
LGBTQIA people, and people with disabilities.

As a relatively small program needing to grow in the areas of
interaction, service, graphic, and industrial design, we are less
concerned right now with hiring in any one of these areas of
specialization than in being led by and collaborating with faculty
colleagues whose practice and teaching will help orient the
department toward social justice, inclusion, and equity.

Qualifications

Required Qualifications:
To be considered for this position, you must:

hold a terminal degree in your field by date of hire, OR
possess a record of equivalent professional experience or
scholarly/creative achievement;
have a record of working productively with people of diverse
disciplines, ranks, races, ethnicities, nationalities, gender
identities, sexual orientations, ages, and abilities;
demonstrate a high level of craft in one or more subfields of
design, including expertise with contemporary design processes,
workflows, and relevant software.


Desired Qualifications:
We are particularly interested in candidates who:

can teach UI/UX design, industrial design, graphic design, or
service/experience design;
engage in creative or scholarly work that centers on issues of
race, ethnicity, decoloniality, intersectionality, oppression,
resistance, and/or activism;
have a record of teaching, scholarship, professional practice,
creative activity, and/or service that centers on ensuring that
design serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races,
ethnicities, genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic
statuses, nationalities, and linguistic and cultural
traditions;
have taught both small- and large-enrollment courses;
have taught hybrid and/or online courses.


Responsibilities of this position may
include:

teaching introductory courses in the Design BA, BFA, and MFA
programs and/or MA in Design in Health program (to both design
majors and curious non-majors from engineering, business, computer
science, medicine, and other fields);
developing and teaching introductory through advanced
undergraduate and graduate courses, including thematic/special
topics courses, in your area of specialization;
team-teaching interdisciplinary courses that enroll students
from multiple majors;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate independent
studies;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate final projects,
exhibitions, and/or reports;
writing or revising undergraduate and graduate curricula;
serving on department, school, college, and/or university
committees.


Faculty appointed with tenure or to the tenure track are also
expected to maintain an active agenda of scholarly research,
professional practice, and/or creative work that creates or
sustains their national profile in the field. Non-tenure-track
faculty are encouraged—but not required—to maintain an active
professional practice or scholarly research program.

Application Instructions

To apply for the position, please submit the following to
Interfolio at https://apply.interfolio.com/82052:

A letter of application explaining your qualifications for, and
interest in, the position, including discussion of your most
significant research/creative/professional, teaching, and service
activities in the arena of design for equity, diversity, inclusion,
and/or social justice;
A curriculum vitae (CV) or professional resume;
A link to or pdf of a portfolio of recent design work
Contact information for three references (letters will be
requested only for finalists).


Applications received by January 22, 2021 will be assured a full
review. Applications received after that date will be reviewed as
needed until the position is filled. Due to current travel
restrictions, we expect to conduct all interviews remotely.

Questions about the application process and Interfolio may be
directed to SDCT Executive Assistant Mr. Cameron Weed at cweed@austin.utexas.edu;
questions about the positions themselves may be directed to search
committee chair Prof. Jason Wilkins at jasonwilkins@utexas.edu.

If you are excited about the possibilities of working in the
Department of Design, but don't fit this particular job
description, please see our open call for faculty at https://apply.interfolio.com/79104.

About the Department of Design
The design program at UT, formerly a division of the Department of
Art and Art History, became the Department of Design in 2017 and
combined forces with the recently created Department of Arts and
Entertainment Technologies, the Center for Integrated Design, and
the Design Institute for Health to form the new School of Design
and Creative Technologies (SDCT). The move to SDCT has enabled the
design program to expand its enrollment and course offerings to
meet growing demand from majors and non-majors and to develop
industry partnerships. The department now offers two undergraduate
degrees and two graduate degrees, as well as extensive additional
coursework geared toward students majoring elsewhere on campus who
wish to be more designerly in their approach to their work.

About The University of Texas at Austin
The University of Texas at Austin is a flagship, comprehensive
research university of over 50,000 students that is routinely
ranked in the top 50 universities globally by U.S. News and World
Report, Times Higher Education, and the Center for World University

renowned for its vibrant cultural life and its thriving creative
and tech industries. Austin is routinely included in top-ten lists

opportunity/affirmative action employer, complies with all
applicable federal and state laws regarding nondiscrimination and
affirmative action. The University is committed to a policy of
equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the

About the University:
California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in 2002 as the newest campus in the California State University system. Since that time, the University has grown and developed into one of the premier public universities, not only in the California State University system, but also in the nation. Indeed, U.S. News & World Report listed CSUCI as 20th among “Top Public Schools” in its 2021 edition of Best Colleges Rankings. In 2020, CollegeNET also ranked CSUCI 20th out of over 1,449 schools in its “Social Mobility Index,” and Money Magazine rated CSUCI as the 15th “Most Transformative College” in the nation.
CSUCI is a public comprehensive university that engages students in critical inquiry and is dedicated to educating leaders for a global society. The University is located in Ventura County and is home to more than 6,900 undergraduate and 239 graduate students. Approximately 55% of CSUCI’s students are Pell Grant eligible, and approximately 62% are first-generation college students. CSUCI is also proud to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), with 55% of its undergraduate students self-identifying as Latinx, 25% as White, 6% as Asian/Asian American, 4% as multiracial, and 2% as Black/African American. In 2019, CSUCI was awarded Excelencia in Education’s inaugural “Seal of Excelencia” for its facilitation of Latinx student success.
CSUCI is committed to diversifying its faculty in order to address students’ ever-changing needs in the 21st century. The University is also taking steps to confront racism and to advocate for social justice. To this end, CSUCI encourages applicants to apply who are motivated to serve and contribute to the university’s tenure-track body, which self-identifies as 62% White, 21% Latinx, 9% Asian/Asian American, and 2% Black/African American.
 
Diversity Statement: 
CSUCI is committed to recruiting individuals who are dedicated to furthering inclusive excellence in our campus community. We seek to enhance our diverse University population by welcoming people from all backgrounds, and by working to sustain an environment where colleagues can not only work and learn, but also create and thrive.
 
CSUCI Mission Statement: 
Placing students at the center of the educational experience, California State University Channel Islands provides undergraduate and graduate education that facilitates learning within and across disciplines through integrative approaches, emphasizes experiential and service learning, and graduates students with multicultural and international perspectives.
 
CSUCI’s Commitment to You:
CSUCI is committed to helping newly hired faculty develop a sense of belonging in a collaborative and supportive community dedicated to providing resources and opportunities for establishing and sustaining a research agenda and engaging in continuous improvement in equitable teaching and learning.
 
About the Program:
The School of Education (SOE) at CI has two Master of Arts Programs—each with two emphases. The MA in Educational Leadership prepares students for careers in Higher Education or in P12 leadership through a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential. The MA in Education, with emphases in Curriculum & Instruction and Disability Studies, advances the careers of teachers and policy advocates. Other programs in the SOE include Teacher Credential Programs which serve candidates seeking elementary, secondary or special education teaching credentials with the option of earning the Bilingual Authorization in Spanish, and two undergraduate programs offering Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies and Early Childhood Studies.
Our Mission: The School of Education at California State University Channel Islands serves students, families, and communities by effectively preparing culturally competent teachers and leaders who work collaboratively to inspire learning and promote equity in and through education.

Nuestra misión: La Escuela de Educación de California State University Channel Islands sirve a estudiantes, familias y comunidades por medio de la preparación efectiva de maestras/os y líderes culturalmente competentes que trabajan en colaboración para inspirar el aprendizaje y promover la equidad en y a través de la educación.
 
About the Position: 
The School of Education (SOE) at CSU Channel Islands (CSUCI) seeks a ranked professor, innovative leader, and master pedagogue with a background in anti-racism and Black/African American populations to join the work of our current teaching credential, early childhood, and graduate programs and to lead the creation of a Master of Arts degree in Anti-Racist Education and Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy.
Building on these changes in the CSU and this campus, an MA in Anti-Racist Education and Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy would offer an advanced degree intentionally designed to further emancipatory work around equity and social justice in our region and beyond. Given the representation of historically marginalized communities in Ventura county, and the demographic composition of students at the university, many of whom are first-generation and Latinx, CSUCI can lead the work of preparing and supporting educational leaders, scholars, and practitioners dedicated to critical, anti-racist, and abolitionist goals. CSUCI and the SOE have the potential to shape the future of an entire region by educating the next generation of educational leaders in anti-racist and culturally sustaining work.
An MA degree provides opportunities for early childhood educators, K-12 teachers, school/district administrators and other community members to enhance their options for leadership and activism. While a Bachelor’s degree opens doors for educators and other professionals in the community, an MA in Anti-Racist and Culturally Responsive Education will attract CSUCI alumni and non-alumni who wish to extend their learning and/or pursue advanced positions of influence. Creating and sustaining this degree will also provide opportunities for the SOE and CSUCI to deepen community partnerships with local schools, community/grassroots organizations, and community colleges.
An innovative degree in Anti-Racist and Culturally Responsive Education aligns with CSUCI’s multi-cultural, international, service learning, and interdisciplinary pillars and, when completed, will:

Join two stateside MA degree programs as the most affordable graduate degrees in Ventura county and wil be interdisciplinary in nature:


Discipline/Program-rooted courses explore foundations of structural racism via specific scholarly and research base (Historical, Sociological, Political, Psychological, Economic, etc)
School of Education courses complete the MA with focus on the praxis of AR/CS pedagogy and operationalizing the theories and concepts.


Help build and redouble institutional commitments to a graduate-student culture on campus;
Serve as a hub for professional development and as a point of connection for university professors to learn with, and from P-12 colleagues and community partners;
Advance the teacher-scholar model wherein original research informs teaching and pedagogy, and vice-versa.

Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and
Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through
this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.
