the Department of Puerto Rican and Latino Studies provides students

School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), the PRLS department
shares the school’s goal to foster collaborative engagement among
faculty, students, and communities, in the co-creation of
knowledge. Our students build skills in critical thinking, creative
expression, data analysis, and the capacity to articulate
evidence-based decisions. The PRLS department, and HSS at large,
prepares students to be adaptive and resilient in a rapidly
changing global economy, and to be effective publicly engaged world
citizens.
 
Brooklyn College serves students from as many as 150 countries

immigrant and first-generation college students from the diverse
communities that make up our city and state.” The college ethos is
strongly invested in the educational and career success of a
population that encompasses a multiplicity of nationalities,
ethnicities, religions, cultures and languages. We are committed to
fostering a spirit of camaraderie and shared ideals across the
entire spectrum of our varied constituency.  By accessing a
first-class and affordable college education in an inclusive and
nurturing intellectual milieu, our students acquire the skills,
confidence, and global mindedness that allow them to thrive in a
rapidly changing, unpredictable marketplace of ideas that is
increasingly mindless of borders and spans the gamut of cultures
and vernaculars.
 
To this end, the college seeks faculty who are eager to engage
with the diversity of our student body and have a demonstrated
commitment to inclusion and heterogeneity through teaching,
research and/or service. We seek to recruit and retain faculty from
historically underrepresented communities who reflect the mosaic of
our student population. The search is one in a college-wide cluster
hire that seeks faculty with a research focus on race, ethnicity
and racial justice. Successful candidates will bring their unique
creativity, sensitivity, insights and perspectives to a community
that welcomes innovation in scholarship and teaching. Together we
will model the finest that a public urban liberal arts, sciences,
and professional studies college can be for the present and
future.

Position Announcement
The University of Oregon College of Arts of Sciences (CAS) seeks a
senior scholar and experienced administrator to serve as Executive
Director (ED) of the university's new School of Global Studies and
Languages (GSL). The ED will report to the CAS Dean and will
oversee operations of the School's constituent units, which include
the Department of Global Studies and four language and literature
departments/programs: East Asian Languages and Literatures; German
and Scandinavian; Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies; and
Romance Languages. The School is also home to the Yamada Language
Center, Northwest Indian Language Institute, and six area studies
programs: African Studies, Asian Studies, European Studies, Judaic
Studies, Latin American Studies, and Middle East and North African
Studies.

The ED will have the unique opportunity to guide the new School in
implementing a vision to become a top destination for students who
want global careers. The distinctive features of the School will be
an interdisciplinary curriculum that engages students in language
learning and major world issues (e.g., climate change) from a
diversity of perspectives in structured, professional pathways that
seamlessly launch students from their academic pursuits into
exciting and meaningful global careers. It will also integrate
co-curricular experiences, such as study abroad, internships, and
other experiential learning opportunities, with the curriculum and
provide advising services to help match students to these
experiences (e.g., creating study abroad programs that offer
internships connected to a student's curricular pathway).

The ED will also be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day
operations of the School and managing resource allocations across
its units. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are foundational
principles of the School, and the ED should be committed to and
experienced in bringing a DEI lens in all aspects of the School.
The ED will be expected to be a vigorous advocate for the School
and to pursue significant external funding.

The new School builds on a number of existing strengths. Our
language and literature departments teach 17 different languages
and related literatures in person, and we consistently rank in the
top 20 of all U.S. universities in number of annual conferred
language degrees. We already offer a popular Global Studies degree
and rank top 20 in placement of graduates into the Peace Corps. We
have a strong, research-active faculty as befitting an R1
university that is a member of the Association of American
Universities, and offer 12 graduate programs across the departments
and programs that comprise the new School.

The ED should be a tenured scholar whose scholarship will be
directly related to one or more of the disciplines that make up the
School's extensive purview. The successful candidate must be
capable of leading by example the effort to support and strengthen
intersections of research and teaching between our language and
literature departments and the social science disciplines, as well
as have strong interpersonal skills, including demonstrated
abilities in communication and collaborative interaction with
diverse groups and populations.

Department or Program Summary
GSL aspires to draw students to UO by engaging them with cultures,
languages, histories, and ways of life across the world. The
School's mission is to prepare graduates for their future lives and
careers by providing holistic, interdisciplinary perspectives on
critical issues and cultural developments that are global and
historical in scope. GSL provides a career-legible,
interdisciplinary curriculum, drawing on the research and pedagogic
expertise of faculty in the social sciences and humanities.
Customized curricular pathways allow students to acquire
foundational skills in the liberal arts and to translate them into
real-world abilities. The School is home to a community of students
and faculty who value the common transformational experience of
immersion in multiple languages and cultures. This shared value
forges a collective mission, while honoring the diverse histories,
cultures, and disciplines embraced by GSL.

Alongside the School's focus on cultures and languages, GSL
immerses students in humanistic and social science perspectives and
methods of inquiry. Students will pursue language learning,
cultural studies, and engage undergraduate professional tracks,
including international law, diplomacy, human rights, global health
and development, and global environmental change, all of which
position them to bring humanities-informed cultural understanding
to careers that have global impact. The School provides students
with language and intercultural skills that align with their
individual academic and career goals and that prepare them for
future opportunities and in a 21st-century global context. Students
study abroad, engage in experiential learning that bridges
theoretical knowledge and its practical application, and
participate in career-readiness activities at every step of their
degree progress.

area and is home to many agricultural associations such as the
Texas Cattle Feeders Association and the American Quarter Horse
Association.
 
Responsibilities of the Positions

service activities. The distribution of effort toward each activity
will be individualized for each faculty member and outlined in the
letter of appointment.

anticipation of instructing students in their clinical year such as
expanding the clinical caseload; supporting the practice
consultation services; advancing the education of veterinary
practitioners; and supervision of clinical year students.  The
TTU SVM does not have a teaching hospital and thus clinical service
will be limited as per above.

department-like structures) within the School, the successful
candidates will report to the Associate Dean for Academic and
Student Affairs.
Participation on various School committees.

Assistant/Associate/Full Professor - Bioengineering -
Single-cell, Multi-omic Technologies

About Northeastern:
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and
the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our
world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students,
faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the
confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto;
Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and
Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through
this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:
The Department of Bioengineering at Northeastern University invites
applications for tenured or tenure-track appointments at the
assistant, associate or full professor level. We seek exceptional
candidates in the area of single-cell, multi-omic technologies with
the potential for driving the transition from descriptive
tabulations of molecular participants in cellular systems to
quantitative models of human pathophysiology. Although the first
wave of single-cell technologies was driven by RNA sequencing
methodologies, we envision a next generation of approaches focused
on single-cell proteomics and related technologies with
applications to immuno-oncology, autoimmunity, neuroscience,
developmental biology and others. Areas of interest include, but
are not limited, development of novel technologies that enable
quantitative tracking of multi-faceted dynamics within single
cells; advances in computational strategies that make best use of
the highly complex single-cell data sets being generated; and
construction of quantitative biochemical and biophysical models of
cellular systems.

The Department of Bioengineering (bioe.northeastern.edu) includes
27 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 36% of whom are women; five
full-time teaching faculty; and 47 faculty with affiliates
appointments. BioE enrolls approximately 600 undergraduate
students; 90 MS students; and 80 PhD students.

Responsibilities:
Candidates are expected to show potential/vision for or have
demonstrated establishing an excellent nationally and
internationally recognized research program and strong record in
extramurally funded research. Candidates will also need to
demonstrate high quality in teaching and contribute to advancing
BIOE education programs. In addition, candidates should be prepared
to contribute to department, college and university service.

Qualifications:
Successful candidates must have a PhD in Bioengineering or a
closely related discipline from an accredited institution by the
appointment start date. Senior-level candidates must have a
demonstrated record of funded and collaborative research,
recognition for accomplished teaching and a track record in
supporting or leading efforts for inclusion and diversity. Junior
applicants should demonstrate the ability to develop an innovative,
externally funded and collaborative research program. As education
is a cornerstone of our Department, candidates should describe
their expertise and ability to engage in trainees both in and out
of the classroom is preferred.

Assistant/Associate/Full Professor - Educational Leadership,
Policy, and Organizations - Graduate School of Education

The University of California Berkeley School of Education (GSE)
seeks a tenured or non-tenured scholar for the position of
Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor. We imagine that the
candidate will be in, or moving toward, mid-career as an advanced
Assistant or Associate Professor with an exemplary scholarly record
sufficient to be awarded tenure at UC Berkeley at the time of hire
or shortly thereafter. This scholar should be trained in the social
sciences and will teach in the Master's, Ed.D. and Ph.D. programs
of the GSE's Policy, Politics, and Leadership (PPL) cluster as well
as in its professional Leadership Programs. There also will be
opportunities to teach in the school's Undergraduate Education
Programs (UEP). Issues of equity, particularly racial equity, are
central to the mission and goals of the GSE. Thus, the successful
candidate will have demonstrated commitment to and a record of
advancing equity through research, teaching, and service.

Educational leaders have critical roles in shaping and responding
to ideologies, power relationships, cultures, values, and human and
material resources that are instantiated through policies and
institutions that determine the viability of schooling to help make
democracy real. We seek a scholar with a compelling theoretical and
methodologically rigorous research agenda and trajectory that
centers on one or more of several possible foci, including but not
limited to: 1) macro-level structures and institutional practices,
and how leadership is embedded within them and potentially
influences their transformation; 2) broad policy, political, legal,
and historical forces in our racialized society that shape the
function and dynamics of leadership and its impacts on learning in
and beyond schools; 3) innovative investigations of organizational
and resource management that reveal what leaders need to know and
be able to do to enable more equitable and humanizing student and
stakeholder outcomes; 4) research-practice partnerships to enhance
professional learning and continuous improvement of PreK-12
schooling processes and cultures.

The GSE's Policy, Politics, and Leadership cluster engages rich
theories and multi-methodological empirical studies and offers the
MA and Ph.D. degrees. The GSE's Leadership Programs include the
Principal Leadership Program (PLI), an MA and licensure program,
and the Leaders for Equity and Democracy (LEAD) Ed.D. Our
Leadership Programs also are home to the 21st Century School
Leadership Academy State Center (21CSLA), California's initiative
for high quality, equity centered professional learning for
educational leaders of schools and districts that receive Title II
funds. All of these Leadership Programs provide significant
opportunities for research and interaction with local and state
level leaders and cross-sectional institutions.

Responsibilities:

Conduct an innovative program of research and generate external
funding to support on-going research and graduate student
researchers in line with scholarly interests.
Develop and effectively teach doctoral and master's level
courses (and possible undergraduate courses) in areas of the
scholar's expertise and in line with curricular goals including
addressing issues of race and equity of the PPL academic cluster
and the Leadership Programs. Some Leadership Program classes meet
in the evenings, on Saturdays, and during summer
sessions.
Collaborate with the on-going work and meetings of PPL and the
Leadership Programs.
Effective mentoring, support, and training of diverse doctoral
and master's students in research, writing, and other scholarly
activities to meet MA, Ed.D., and Ph.D. degree completion
milestones and requirements and guide their overall professional
development.

Position description
Computing provides a powerful new lens for viewing the world.
The questions of where we choose to turn this lens, who gets to
look through this lens, and what new steps society takes based on
the information provided by this lens are some of the most
important questions that we could ask ourselves. UC Santa Barbara
understands that this is too important to the future of our society

bringing computation and computational tools to problems of
societal importance. We seek motivated and passionate researchers
eager to work with a community of their peers to address issues of
societal importance through surprising and creative applications of
computing. The department is especially interested in candidates

student, faculty, and staff can grow and thrive we will position
ourselves to best be able to take on these challenges together!

faculty and all applicants must have a demonstrated record of
excellence in, or show exceptional promise for, high-quality
research, teaching, and service to the community. Applicants with a

opportunities for our diverse student body (e.g. through the Los
Ingenieros, UCSB Women in Computer Science, the Early Research
Scholars Program, or the CBSR Student Engagement and Enrichment in
Data Science Program).
Candidates will be considered for the endowed Stansbury Chair in
Computer Science. Stansbury Chair appointments focus on attracting
a leading-edge junior scientist and educator working in
cutting-edge areas that help the University prepare our students

Position Announcement
The University of Oregon's School of Journalism and Communication
seeks a tenure-track Assistant Professor with a research and
teaching emphasis in the area of Digital Platforms and Ethics. We
seek to hire a colleague who will conduct research on and teach
ethics in the context of mass media, communication, and digital
media technologies—including internet platforms, software,
algorithms, and technical infrastructure. Apps, algorithms, and
digital platforms dominate much of our economy, politics, culture,
and everyday lives, with consequences for communication, mass
media, democracy, and public life. For example, the ascendancy of
Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft requires assessment
of issues ranging from bias built into software to monopolization
of online markets and even their role in the rise and spread of
misinformation around COVID-19, climate change, and recent
elections.

The hire would bring the following key contributions to our
faculty:

1) Expertise in theories and concepts pertinent to media ethics
generally and digital media ethics specifically, including issues
of free speech, privacy, surveillance, transparency, content
moderation, platform power, trust, misinformation, and/or human
rights;
2) A related specialty, such as the study of algorithms, software,
platforms and infrastructures, and/or critical approaches to
programming; and
3) A capacity to teach our required Media Ethics course, other core
courses (such as Media and Society and courses within our four
undergraduate and graduate sequences as related to their area(s) of
expertise), as well as develop innovative courses across the
SOJC.

This person must have a Ph.D. in communication, media studies,
journalism, information science/studies, philosophy, or another
related field (or Juris Doctorate) in hand by time of appointment;
demonstrated potential for teaching excellence; ability to execute
independent and/or collaborative research that advances theory and
bridges knowledge and practice; and a record or promise of
scholarly accomplishment that includes publication of peer-reviewed
articles and publication in academic journals in communication,
media studies, journalism, information studies, surveillance
studies, and/or related fields.

This faculty hire will join our Media Studies area, which focuses
on three key areas: Media Technologies and Public Life, Media
Structures and Regulation, and Culture and Power in the Media.
Further, they should contribute to making the SOJC a destination
for graduate and undergraduate students to engage with and
understand the ethical, social, and cultural implications of
digital technologies. This hire would ideally strengthen SOJC's
ties to other units on campus, including existing collaborations
with CAS (e.g., the annual Data|Media|Digital Graduate Symposium),
the campus-wide New Media and Culture Certificate program for
graduate students, the ethics minor in philosophy, and UO's Data
Sciences Initiative, through a practical orientation to ethical
issues in society. Finally, the ideal candidate will have strong
potential to mentor undergraduate and graduate students as well as
strong potential for and commitment to contributing to a culture of
inclusive teaching and evidence of valuing diversity, equity, and
inclusion.

This position is based in Eugene.

Oregon (UO) invites applications for a tenure-track position for an
Assistant Professor in Science and Risk Communication with an

Position Announcement
The Department of Art at the University of Oregon is accepting
applications for a tenure-track faculty position in photography at
the rank of Assistant Professor with a start date of September 16,
2022. The position is a full-time, nine-month academic year
appointment.

We seek a faculty member whose creative research locates the medium
of photography firmly within the context of contemporary art and
interdisciplinarity, while finding its footing in a lens-based
practice. With an aptitude in both digital technologies and
traditional analog methods, the ideal candidate for this position
will also have fluency in contemporary cultural and aesthetic
theory, with an interest in course development in this area.

The successful candidate will have the ability to work effectively
with faculty, staff, and students from a variety of diverse
backgrounds and media areas. An MFA, or equivalent terminal degree
is required. A minimum of three years college teaching experience
beyond graduate school is preferred. The candidate should have a
strong and active exhibition/publication record.

Some potential areas of research interest for the ideal candidate
are:

Artists with a clear interdisciplinary and installation-related
approach to the medium whose practice draws from the cultural and
aesthetic potency of photography's indexical relationship to the
visible world, either through lens-based original capture or
archival appropriation.

Artists with a lens-based approach to the medium whose practice
taps into the directed/performative potential of photography, while
engaging larger questions of identity, race and/or gender.

Artists with a “documentary” approach to the medium whose
practice expands on how this generic term is understood and
engaged, either through a deep theoretical investment in
documentary practices, or by bridging their production to other
forms, such as performance and video, or working with photographic
archives to locate and amplify the cultural signs and symbols
embedded in every photographic image.

Primary teaching responsibilities will be focused in the
photography area, with additional interdisciplinary opportunities,
including graduate seminars, advanced studios and experimental
courses. The University of Oregon operates on a system of three
10-week quarters with a typical load of five courses per year.
Additionally, all faculty participate in graduate studio
mentorship. Service responsibilities include committee
contributions, advising, and participation in shared governance. In
addition to teaching and service responsibilities, the successful
candidate will be expected to demonstrate a commitment to a
sustained and developing creative practice, with an active and
ongoing exhibition/publishing record.

Entering faculty generally will not supervise student employees
(undergraduate and graduate), adjunct faculty, or classified staff,
but may do so once tenure is granted.

Department or Program Summary
Situated within a nationally recognized research institution, the
Department of Art attracts students and faculty who value the study
of studio art in the context of a larger intellectual and critical
environment. Our curriculum reflects a diverse and fluid set of
creative practices and critical methodologies. Students engage
broad and interdisciplinary approaches, as well as depth within
specific media area practices. A robust visiting lecture series,
bringing 10-12 artists, critics and curators to campus each year,
complements the curriculum. Nationally and internationally active,
the faculty thrive on making connections between their individual
studio practices and teaching. While we have diverse backgrounds,
philosophies and approaches, we have a strong commitment to a
collective mission and a shared governance model.

The Department of Art is one of the two departments within the
School of Art + Design within the College of Design, which also
includes Architecture, the History of Art and Architecture, Arts
Administration, Product Design, Landscape Architecture, Historic
Preservation, and Planning, Public Policy and Management. With more

ceramics, art & technology (print media, animation, video and
interactivity), fibers, jewelry and metals, painting and drawing,
photography, printmaking, and sculpture. The Department includes 21
tenure-track faculty and 12 Career Instructors.

The photography area is one of eight media areas in the Department
of Art. The area currently has one Tenure Track and two Non-Tenure
Track faculty. Classes in the photography area emphasize conceptual
and contextual engagement with the medium and offer instruction in
analog and digital methods of image making. The area offers a
breadth of courses driven by both concept and process to emphasize
the wide range of possibilities within the medium. Our course
offerings interweave contemporary critical theory alongside the
history of photography in a comprehensive curriculum that develops
students' artistic practice, critical thinking and writing
skills.

Faculty and students working in the photography area have access to
a range of spaces and equipment to support the development of
creative research, including: a lighting studio, digital output
workspaces equipped with large format Epson printers, darkrooms
(including numerous private spaces) equipped with enlargers
accommodating all film formats, ranging from 35 mm to 8 x 10, an
alternative process and mural printing room with ultraviolet
exposure unit, a Hasselblad Flextight X-1 drum quality film
scanner, and view cameras and DSLRs for checkout.

Department Summary
The Labor Education and Research Center (LERC) is a state-wide
program that combines teaching, research, and public service to
improve the lives of Oregon's workers, their families, and their
communities. Since its creation in 1977, LERC has provided
teaching, research, strategic planning and technical assistance
services to unions, other worker's organizations, and working
adults in Oregon and throughout the Pacific Northwest. Throughout
its history LERC has served as a catalyst for critical analysis,
strategic thinking, and concerted action aimed at strengthening
labor organizations and improving the lives of working
Oregonians.

With offices on the Eugene Campus and at UO Portland, LERC faculty
have strong roots in the union movement and expertise in a variety
of academic disciplines. In addition to teaching working adults,
LERC faculty members conduct research on relevant work, employment,
and public policy issues. They also work extensively with policy
makers, university faculty, labor relations professionals, and
community leaders on issues of concern to Oregon workers. LERC is
committed to promoting equity, diversity, and inclusive workplaces.
We practice this internally and also incorporate these concepts in
our teaching and public presentations.

A thirty-member advisory board provides LERC with support,
guidance, and strategic advice. The program enjoys an excellent
reputation at both the state and national levels as a valued
resource that works diligently to meet the multiple needs of its
constituents. For more information about LERC, please visit our
website: http://lerc.uoregon.edu/

Position Summary
The Career Instructor is a labor educator who will design and teach

organizations operate (e.g. labor history, electoral politics, the
domestic and global economy, community outreach and coalition
building);
Skills needed for effective union leadership (e.g. strategic
planning, member recruitment, organizational development,
interpersonal communications, internal and external organizing; and
strategies for embedding equity & inclusion in workers'

Position Announcement
The Department of Special Education and Clinical Sciences in the
University of Oregon's College of Education (COE) seeks an
established scholar to join our faculty as the Bricker/Squires
Chair of Early Intervention. The successful candidate will have
expertise, and a demonstrated record of scholarship, focusing on
early intervention and early childhood populations (e.g., screening
and assessment; family engagement; infant mental health;
social-emotional development; school readiness; early learning
programs; implementation science, etc.). We are particularly
interested in a scholar with a demonstrated track record of
conducting research and scholarship on the intersection between one
or more focus areas, and racial, cultural, and/or linguistic
diversity. We are equally committed to increasing the diversity of

of approximately 72,000. Part of the Greater Hartford area of 1.2
million residents, New Britain is centrally located in the state
and is within easy reach of much of Connecticut and several
metropolitan areas. Nicknamed “the Hardware City” for its rich
industrial heritage, it is home to Stanley Black & Decker.
Important cultural institutions include the New Britain Museum of
American Art and Walnut Hill Park, designed by Fredrick Law

backgrounds. In addition to all that greater Hartford provides, New
Britain is 40 minutes from Springfield, Massachusetts, two hours

of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position. Candidates
whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree exactly as
listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent qualifications

match will not be considered outside of the equivalency
process.
The equivalency review is an independent
process for district wide disciplines that is separate from the
recruitment process to fill a vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline

review the equivalency materials and make a recommendation as to
whether or not the applicant demonstrated they have qualifications
that are equivalent to those shown in the minimum qualifications
section of the job posting. For disciplines that are unique to a
specific campus the equivalency may be done by the hiring committee
along with an Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the

food security and sovereignty while building the capacity for
future generations to do the same. This starts with reducing soil
and nutrient runoff, minimizing groundwater contamination,
fostering biodiversity, supporting thriving communities, and
helping to stabilize the climate. Developing, improving, and
expanding perennial or continuous cover agroecosystems is a
critical part of achieving this goal. Continuous cover
agroecosystems include permanent pastures, forages, perennial
crops, and other cropping systems that mitigate environmental
concerns while also providing feed for livestock. This vision of
sustainability is central to our collective mission at the
UW-Madison College of Agricultural & Life Sciences and
Department of Agronomy.

Thus, the Department of Agronomy seeks a 9-month tenure track or

that fit the aforementioned challenges. Commitment to Extension and
outreach activities and documenting impact of efforts is a critical
component of this position, as is mentoring, supporting and
developing students in a collaborative environment. The Department
of Agronomy is committed to inclusivity and diversity; therefore,
we strongly encourage applications from candidates who foster and
promote these values.

Principal duties:
The candidate will be expected to:
1. CALS Extension-funded faculty are expected to generate,
translate, and apply research-based knowledge and methods to issues
and problems by integrating research and educational activities
into a coherent body of work. CALS Extension-funded faculty are
expected to provide leadership in the design, development, and
implementation of educational programs and to document the impact
of these efforts.
2. Develop an independent, externally-funded and recognized
Extension and research program at the state, regional, national,
and international levels.
3. Teach graduate and undergraduate students, commensurate with
college expectations and consistent with the teaching loads of the
department. Mentor students and promote their development and
success in a collaborative environment.
4. Contribute to outreach and service functions of the department,
college, university, and professional societies.
5. Contribute to programs aimed at increasing diversity, equity,
and inclusion within the department, college, and university.
Promote an inclusive and diverse climate within our campus and

ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
GSU is a leading urban research university located in the heart
of Atlanta. It is the largest university in Georgia with more than
50,000 students enrolled continues to lead the state and nation in
graduating economically and racially diverse students on-time and
at a reasonable cost. Pell-eligible students, many of whom are
first-generation college students, currently represent 58% of the
University’s undergraduate student population, ranking first among
all national universities in the percent of Pell students that it
enrolls.
GSU confers more bachelor’s degrees to African Americans than
any other non-profit college or university in the United States.
Georgia State has eliminated achievement gaps based on race,
ethnicity or income. For the last four years, GSU has been the only
national university at which Black, Hispanic, first-generation and
low-income students graduated at rates at or above the rate of the
student body overall. As a result of these efforts, in May 2018,
The New York Times ran a feature article on Georgia State,
calling the institution “an engine of social mobility.” U.S.
News & World Report ranks Georgia State as the 3rd Most
Innovative University in the Country.
Based on data from diverseeducation.com, the Computer Science
and CIS Departments ranked 4th nationally to African Americans and
14th to Asian Americans conferring undergraduate degrees in
information systems (IS) and computer science.
With more than 8,000 students and 170 faculty members, RCB is
one of the largest and most diverse business schools in the
country. According to Standard & Poor’s, more Georgia
executives hold graduate degrees from Robinson and Georgia State
than from any other school in the nation. The college is highly
ranked: according to the University of Texas at Dallas Top 100
Business School Research Ranking, Robinson’s research productivity
makes us #1 in Georgia and #4 in the Southeast. Its flagship
part-time MBA is ranked among the best by Bloomberg Businessweek
and U.S. News & World Report, and its Executive MBA is
considered by Financial Times to be one of the world’s premier
programs.
Using its current strategic plan, Advancing Vision 2020, as a
guide, Robinson is extending its perspectives and competencies into
new areas – computer science, statistics, engineering, science and
technology – and integrating them into the core activities of the
business school. Students now connect these analytical skills with
business concepts in newly developed immersive experiences that
allow them to adapt to and innovate in rapidly changing
environments. These strategic investments and initiatives have
advanced the college towards its vision of faculty and students
creatively designing implementable strategies that address
real-world challenges and transform industry partners that impact
industry, Atlanta and the world in positive ways.

The Department of Kinesiology at The Pennsylvania State University
is seeking a full-time faculty member at the rank of Assistant
Professor (tenure track) in the area of Psychology of Physical

appropriate area within or related to Kinesiology. The successful
candidate must have a record of scholarly accomplishments,
including success or promise in obtaining extramural funding for
research, and have a commitment to teaching excellence at both the

encourages applications and nominations of women and persons of
underrepresented groups. Post-doctoral experience and an
established research program are preferred. Preference will be
given to a candidate whose research builds on existing strengths in
the department. This position will begin in Fall 2022.

programs nationally and is internationally recognized for its
research accomplishments. The Department currently enrolls

interventions. While we are interested in attracting a broad pool
of candidates whose interests fit the position, we are particularly

The Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies
(NAIS) invites applicants at the master and
doctoral levels who can contribute to and share
in the development and
teaching of a meaningful, holistic, and
decolonial Indigenous-centered curriculum.  The
department expressly seeks scholars whose creative
work, scholarship, and teaching is grounded in the
application of Indigenous pedagogies, Indigenous research
methodologies, and/or community-based research
methodologies.  
 
With the generous support of the Mellon
Foundation, we seek to hire four faculty
members who will bring new teaching and research
expertise to the department. We aim to bring together two
tenure-track and two permanent lecturers.
The speciality of candidates is open, but we seek
candidates with expertise in Indigenous research
methodologies, community-based research methodologies, and/or
Indigenous pedagogies and Indigenous education.  Within this
group, we hope to hire a candidate with expertise in Indigenous
language and a candidate with expertise in Indigenous creative
writing, poetics, oral literatures, or
journalism/communication.   
The department is entering a transformative moment in its
history: in the last several years, Fort Lewis College, a Native
American student-serving institution, has begun a
reconciliation process of engaging in truth-telling about its
history as a former Indian boarding school with the
removal of three historical panels from the FLC
clocktower that falsely represented the Fort Lewis
Indian school history in a positive light. With the
addition of new faculty, we seek to continue and guide the
conversation in truth-telling about boarding school
history and engage in practices of healing and
reconciliation. 
The department also seeks to update and expand its
curriculum. Our program seeks to reflect
reconciliation, healing, and resilience and to promote
Indigenous pedadogy and research at
all undergraduate levels. In partnership with these
new faculty, we plan to develop new courses that will
introduce students to Indigenous methodologies and guide
students through the real-world application
of these methodologies. Our program has many
opportunities for innovation and transformation. For
example, we envision the establishment of an Indigenous
garden on campus that will allow our students to have hands-on
instruction, faculty and peer mentoring, and embrace Indigenous
approaches to teaching and learning that incorporate land-based
practices.  In the past, our program also focused
on Indigenous journalism through the production
of Intertribal News, a student-produced biweekly
newspaper; we seek faculty who may like
to reimagine and update this publication to reflect
new forms of media
and communication.                                                                                                                            
These four faculty positions represent
a significant expansion
of the department through the broadening and
deepening of current and yet-to-be developed curricular
offerings and undergraduate research
opportunities for both majors and non-majors. In
addition, these faculty members will join, contribute to, and
sustain a vital, innovative, and
intellectually engaged community of educators
at Fort Lewis College who are committed to
fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic
community. 
   
Required Education, Specialized Skills and
Experience: 

Master’s degree or
higher in a field that supports the teaching of Native
American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS) courses at the college

Health
 
The Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions (CHS)
Population Health program is seeking a full-time, 9-month
tenure-eligible faculty member at the rank of Associate / Full
Professor with a track record of engaging, collaborating, and/or
partnering with Indigenous populations and leaders to increase
equity in population health outcomes among Indigenous
communities. 
 
The College of Health Solutions recently expanded its degrees
(MS, PhD) in Population Health, with doctoral tracks in Health
Equity, Complex Adaptive Systems, and Urban Environments for
Health. The health equity track emphasizes empathetic research,
incorporating the lived experience of populations vulnerable for
health disparities into applied research. Faculty use an
asset-based approach to collaborate with populations to improve
health outcomes to address social determinants of health. In the
complex adaptive systems track, we teach theory, principles,
models, and techniques used to analyze complex systems and data as
applied to population health. Exacerbated by population growth and
climate change, city dwelling populations are experiencing health
challenges such as new and re-emerging infectious diseases,
noncommunicable diseases, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity,
obesity, poor water quality and injuries from road trauma. The
track on urban environments for health prepares graduates to meet
those challenges from an evidence-based and transdisciplinary
environmental perspective.
 
Through teaching, academic programs, service and research, all
faculty at the College of Health Solutions address one or more of
our three major areas of focus: 1) The systems of health care and
the health needs of populations; 2) Health and human performance of
individuals across the lifespan; 3) Personalized interventions
through precision health. Across these areas, we work to address
Grand Challenges, complex and difficult health problems which
require transformative collaboration, translational research and
innovation. We are particularly interested in making an impact on
populations with significant health disparities.
 
Responsibilities for this position include developing and
maintaining a successful research program, teaching undergraduate
and graduate courses, mentoring students and junior faculty
(depending on rank), and providing service to the program
and university as well as to the community and profession. The
ideal candidate will present evidence of a successful research
trajectory commensurate with the rank of Associate / Full
Professor, including a sustained extramural funding and
peer-reviewed publications related to population health, and a
strong commitment to high quality teaching and mentoring.
 
At ASU and the College of Health Solutions, we work to maximize
opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds, abilities and
perspectives. We value and encourage cultural and intellectual
diversity, and strive to foster a welcoming and inclusive
environment for all faculty, staff and students - which we believe
is critical to our success as a community. All individuals who can
strengthen the diversity of our academic community are encouraged
to apply, and will be considered without regard to race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national
origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other basis
protected by law.

requiring all employees of federal contractors to receive COVID-19
vaccinations, ASU expects all employees, including new hires, to be
vaccinated unless they have an approved medical or religious
accommodation.  Proof of vaccination will be required by
