Environmental Neurotoxicity Tenure Track Faculty Position in the
Department of Biobehavioral Health

The Department
of Biobehavioral Health (BBH) in the College of Health and Human
Development (HHD), in partnership with the Huck Institutes for the Life
Sciences, at the Pennsylvania State University invites
applications for an associate or full-rank
tenure-line faculty position focusing on neurotoxicology and
environmental health. The position could start as early as Fall
2023. BBH, which would serve as the home department for the new
position, embraces an interconnected biological and behavioral
approach to health. Qualified candidates could apply this approach
in multiple areas of environmental neurotoxicology that
connect with other research priorities in the department, college,
and University. These include, but are not limited to
neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration and pathologic aging,
occupational health, mental health, and addiction. In particular,
neurotoxicologists interested in the interplay of environmental
exposures and social determinants of health and/or in the impact of
environmental exposures on vulnerable populations are encouraged to
apply. We welcome applicants who have an interest in the novel and
integrative approaches across a range of biological,
socio-cultural, community-based, psychological, and behavioral
data, including neuroscience, biomarkers, imaging, immunology,
genetics, ecological momentary assessment, ambulatory sensors,
qualitative approaches, computational modeling, and/or cutting-edge
statistical approaches; however, qualified applicants should
feature environmental neurotoxicology at the core of their
research. The geographic region of the research may include work
conducted globally and/or in the U.S.

The Department of BBH is a uniquely multi-faceted program that

cultural, and global factors converge to affect health and wellness
across the entire human lifespan. We are particularly interested in
individuals whose research fits within the department's
interdisciplinary focus on integrating biological, environmental,
psychosocial, and contextual processes. Although the tenure home of

This position will build on the existing strengths of BBH and the
Huck Institute which include expertise in interdisciplinary
research on how diverse factors interact to influence health and
well-being. BBH Departmental research examines substantive areas in
which biology and behavior are inextricably interconnected (e.g.,
behavioral neuroscience, psychoneuroimmunology, mental health,
stress, sleep), issues related to chronic disease (aging,
cardiometabolic health, obesity, nutrition), infectious disease
(e.g., HIV), as well as pertinent areas of scholarship that provide
important windows into health such as neuroscience, epigenetics,
health disparities, global public health, environmental justice,
epidemiology, innovative methods, prevention science, and
translational science. Department faculty are highly
research-active, transdisciplinary, and collaborative.

Applicants must demonstrate excellence in environmental
neurotoxicology research, a strong publication record, interest in
collaboration across disciplines, commitment to mentoring students
or early career researchers, and a track record of (or strong
potential for) external grant funding, with excellent potential to
carry forward such research and funding. Responsibilities of this
position include continuing a funded or fundable line of
interdisciplinary biobehavioral health research, teaching graduate
and undergraduate courses, supervising and mentoring student
researchers, and providing service to the Department, College, and
University. A doctorate in neuroscience, toxicology, biology,
chemistry or a related field is required.

Penn State University, the College of Health and Human Development
(HHD), BBH, and the Huck Institute strongly encourage applicants
who would enrich the diversity of our academic community to apply.
Interest in understudied and marginalized populations adds to the
current effort in BBH. To learn more about Penn State's commitment
to diversity and inclusion see Statements on Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion for both the BBH Department https://hhd.psu.edu/bbh/about/diversity-statement and

institution, we embrace individual uniqueness, foster a culture of
inclusion that supports both broad and specific diversity
initiatives, leverage the educational and institutional benefits of
diversity, and engage all individuals to help them thrive. We value
inclusion as a core strength and an essential element of our public
service mission. In HHD, enriching the lives of others is our
mission. We believe in the power of human capacity for growth and
live that mission by meeting challenges, both big and small, with
excitement and energy every day. As a part of this, we
enthusiastically support both broad and specific diversity
initiatives with varied strategies (including via Penn State's
offices for Educational Equity and Affirmative
Action and HHD's Office for Diversity, Equity, and

The MLA program seeks scholar practitioners who care deeply and
widely for the field of landscape architecture in a time of change,
and whose research expands the relationship between the physical
space of landscape and the necessity of digital techniques. More
specifically, the program seeks scholars and practitioners who can
advance a critical agenda on the practical use of geospatial data
under the broad research categories including but not limited to:
ecology as it relates to citizen science, the role of climate
change statistics in environmental decision-making, remote sensing
in relation to labor markets, the inequities of cartography, and
the nuanced application of integrated processing systems, open
source spatial resolutions, and public engagement platforms among
others.

MLA CURRICULUM

The Masters in Landscape Architecture is structured as a three year
program, with the first two years functioning as a core curriculum,
and the third year focused on professional practice.The first year
core lays the foundation to the field through regional scale
analysis, introducing students to landscape planning, public
shorelines, botany, field ecology, cartography and the theory of
evolution.The second year core integrates the critical parameters
of the Borough of Brooklyn and the community scale , through garden
and park making. Students explore the role of landscape through
respectful engagement, and applied fieldwork in the context of one
of the most diverse human and non-human communities in America. The
third year focuses on how landscape research integrates with other
professions, outlooks and methods by working broadly across other
Departments at the School of Architecture and Pratt Institute,
challenging students to define their work by applying core lessons
from first and second year to the expansion of professional
practice and the public nature of construction documentation.

CSULB seeks to recruit faculty who enthusiastically support the
University's strong commitment to the academic success of all of
our students, including students of color, students with
disabilities, students who are first generation to college,
veterans, students with diverse socio-economic backgrounds, and
students of diverse sexual orientations and gender expressions and
identities. CSULB seeks to recruit and retain a diverse workforce
as a reflection of our commitment to serve the People of
California, to maintain the excellence of the University, and to
offer our students a rich variety of expertise, perspectives, and
ways of knowing and learning.

The School of Social Work is proud to be an integral part of a
university that is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution and
an Asian American and Native Pacific Islander Serving Institution
located in a city with a large Cambodian/Cambodian American
population in an aspirational context for increasing Black,
Indigenous and People of Color enrollment. The mission of the
School of Social Work is to educate and graduate diverse, ethical,
competent social work students able to think critically and use
evidence-based practice approaches to effectively serve culturally
diverse, vulnerable individuals, families and communities in a wide
variety of practice areas as practitioners, leaders and social
justice advocates.

Over the past 20 years, our Social Work faculty has assumed
leadership in attracting over $94 million dollars in extramural
funds and secured almost $21 million on behalf of local Long Beach
human services, community organizations and education settings. Our
curriculum prepares graduate students in three specialization
areas: child and family well-being, integrated health, and
adulthood and aging.

The School engages in collaborative, community-based research that
enhances the well-being of vulnerable populations and disadvantaged
communities. The School also engages students at both the bachelor
and graduate levels in curricula that recognizes the importance of
identifying that power and privilege can be a resource. Identifying
and recognizing how power and privilege can be leveraged as a
resource is important to advocate for and/or empower those who may
not have similar power and/or privilege. Our School hopes to
improve service delivery systems and contribute to social work
knowledge. Our School also provides service to the community and
the profession through the development of ongoing relationships
with various groups. Those include grassroots community leaders,
community-based non-profit organizations, governmental
organizations, and foundations.

members are: teaching, research, scholarship, and creative
activity; and service to the University, professional and to the
community. These responsibilities include: advising students,
participation in campus and system-wide communities, maintaining
office hours, working collaboratively and productively with
colleagues, and participation in traditional academic functions.
Probationary faculty are typically provided ongoing mentorship to
be a successful member of the faculty. During the first two years
of the probationary period, teaching responsibilities will be
reduced by approximately one course each semester. The reduced
teaching load supports the establishment of research, scholarship
and/or creative activities required for retention, tenure, and
promotion.

learning opportunities for students, bridging multiple disciplines
across the spectrum. Cal Poly Humboldt is a leader in “learning
communities” that build relationships between students, faculty,
staff, administrators, and the community. These communities
incorporate environmental and social responsibility.

The Cybersecurity program (or CYBR for short) at UNO is an NSA designated Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense (CD) and Cyber Operations (CO), a combination that only a few programs hold nationwide. The CAE-CO program is a deeply technical, inter-disciplinary, higher education program grounded in the computer science, computer engineering, and/or electrical engineering disciplines, with extensive opportunities for hands-on applications via labs. We offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees that engage students in a dynamic and hands-on curriculum that in a metropolitan university includes opportunities for research, creative activity, community service, and strong industry engagement. IS&T also houses the Nebraska University Center for Cybersecurity (NebraskaCYBER), a Nebraska university system-wide center for cybersecurity research, education, and outreach since 2003.

Why UNO? The University of Nebraska at Omaha is fueled by its historical ties to Omaha. As the first municipal university in Omaha, the early founders’ goal was to make higher education accessible and affordable for the city’s residents. In 1968, the campus joined the University of Nebraska system, and today has the unique role of serving as the state’s metropolitan campus.
 
 
 
Accessibility remains a top priority in UNO’s mission and vision. Today, the campus is known for its student-centered environment, its community engagement, and its dedication to embracing students from all types of backgrounds. UNO’s ranking as the 2020 Best College for LGBTQ+ Students In Nebraska reflects a commitment to the Maverick values of access, inclusion and diversity that make UNO a welcoming campus community, evidenced by the numerous resources and support services offered by the university.
 
 
The campus has built strong partnerships with local business, education, government, arts, and civic organizations in the city. UNO’s commitment to community engagement has landed UNO on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for seven consecutive years—the highest federal recognition a school can receive for civic engagement. This honor is but one of many points of pride for UNO. In 2019, it was ranked in the top ten public institutions in the nation for military friendliness by Military Times magazine for the fifth consecutive year. Nearly 90 percent of UNO’s 15,500 students are from Nebraska, and roughly 60 percent of recent alumni surveyed report graduating with no debt or less than $5,000 in debt. It is simply one of the most competitively priced institutions in the region. UNO, while large enough to provide students with global opportunities, thrives on its personal and close-knit campus culture, where students come first and partnerships with the community grow every day.
