doubled.  Success rates at the Canadian tri-councils (SSHRC,
NSERC, and CIHR) have consistently exceeded national
averages. Faculty members have formal research partnerships
with over 100 organizations (local non-profits, regional small and
medium enterprises, national and multinational corporations,
regional health authorities, hospitals, and municipalities), with
activities on the UBC Okanagan Campus and in the Innovation UBC
hub, which is located in downtown Kelowna in the Okanagan’s
thriving tech ecosystem. In

Assistant/Associate/Full Professor - Cluster Hire in Latinxs and
Democracy

The University of California, Berkeley seeks applicants for four
tenure track (Assistant Professor) positions and one tenured
(Associate or Full Professor) position in the area of “Latinxs and
Democracy.” Successful junior candidates will be invited to join
one or more of the following units: College of Letters and Science
(Departments of Sociology, Demography, and Political Science),
School of Social Welfare, and School of Public Health. The senior,
tenured position will be in the Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies
Program in the Department of Ethnic Studies (College of Letters and
Science).

The Latinxs and Democracy Cluster initiative brings together units
in the social sciences and professional schools to address the
US-centered Latinx experience within three overarching themes:
migration and citizenship, civic and political participation, and
social inclusion and wellbeing. These themes speak to central
concepts in the imagining and practicing of democracy because at
their core they tell us about how the state distribution of
political power, through policy and practice, affects a myriad of
social issues, from racial inequality to health disparities. Junior
candidates for the Sociology, Political Science, Demography, and
Public Health positions will be expected to be able to research and
teach about the US Latinx experience (i.e. Latinx Politics, Latinx
Health, Latinx Communities). Applicants at the non-tenured level
should select up to two unit(s) they wish to be considered by.
Should applicants at the non-tenured level wish to be considered
for a joint appointment with Demography, they should select that as
an additional, joint-appointment choice. Senior candidates for the
Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies Program search will be considered at
the Associate and Full Professor levels.

Public Health: Berkeley Public Health will recruit
an assistant professor focused on examining the impact of public
policies on the health of U.S. Latinx populations. Health policy
researchers come from diverse social science backgrounds, including
public policy, health policy, epidemiology, and health services
research, as well as economics, sociology, demography, and
political science.

Political Science: The Department of Political
Science will recruit an assistant professor with a research focus
on the dynamics of Latinx politics in the United States, broadly
understood. This could include a focus on political participation
and behavior, representation and policy responsiveness, political
institutions, and/or changes in political coalitions. Although the
U.S. should be a core focus, comparative approaches/perspectives
are welcome. In addition to an active research agenda in this
field, qualified candidates will be expected to teach courses in
Latinx politics.

Social Welfare: The School of Social Welfare seeks
an assistant professor committed to multi-level practice in areas
such as Latinx civic and political engagement, public policy and
institutions, immigration, and the social problems associated with,
but not limited to, families and the feminization of poverty. An
MSW is preferred and/or community-facing translational scholarly
research attuned to professional practice.

Sociology: The Department of Sociology will
recruit an assistant professor with a research focus on Latinx
immigration and/or Latinx communities in the United States. This
could include attention to racialization processes, immigration
patterns and Latinx demography, civic and political participation,
and Latinx social mobility. While the US Latinx experience should
be a main focus, candidates who employ a transnational/transborder
lens are also welcome to apply.

Demography: The Department of Demography seeks a
dual-appointed assistant professor that will be shared with any of
the departments/schools listed above.

Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies: The Chicana/o and
Latina/o Studies Program in the Department of Ethnic Studies seeks
a tenured (Associate or Full) professor in the Social Sciences
whose dynamic research agenda focuses on the US Latinx experience.
This can include a focus on US Latino communities, immigration,
political participation, demography, and racialization experiences
in any historical or contemporary time period. The scholar should
have an established record in Latinx Studies and the Social
Sciences, and will be expected to lead the new Latinxs and
Democracy Cluster along with affiliated senior faculty. Qualified
candidates will have a history of excellent research, teaching, and
mentorship and will be expected to teach relevant social science
methods courses within the program.

Lecturer - Humanities - Dean's Office of Arts and
Humanities

The Division of Arts and Humanities at the University of
California, Berkeley seeks applications for an outstanding lecturer
to prepare and teach the course HUM 12 “Berkeley Changemakers:
Humanists at Work” during the academic year. Preparation for the
course will take place in the Fall, and the course will be offered
in the Spring.

Responsibilities:
General duties (include but are not limited to): Fall: Curating and
contacting a roster of Berkeley Arts and Humanities alumni,
organizing weekly alumni visits to the class throughout the Spring
semester, developing the course syllabus, working with Career
Services and the Public Service Center to create a list of
available internships and public service projects for interested
students, communicating these opportunities with enrolled students,
guiding their applications to these placements. Spring: Teach HUM
12 “Berkeley Changemakers: Humanists at Work,” a large enrollment
lower-division lecture course; in addition to classroom
responsibilities, general duties include holding office hours,
advising students, preparing course materials, maintaining a course
website, supervising readers (graders), and organizing classroom
visits by A&H alumni.

The Department may request additional documentation from finalist
to verify teaching experience.

The University is committed to addressing the family needs of
faculty and has a number of policies and programs in place to
support employees as they balance work and family. https://ofew.berkeley.edu/welfare/families

About HUM 12 “Berkeley Changemaker: Humanists at Work”
As a connector course to the enormously popular L&S 12: “The
Berkeley Changemaker,” this course will potentially attract 100
lower-division students, who will either take the course for 2
units as a stand-alone, or for 4 units in conjunction with an
internship or public service project. This course will connect the
work students do in their arts and humanities classrooms to the
social and professional worlds at large in several ways: by
connecting them to Berkeley A&H alumni who are now changemakers
in their fields, by giving them the skills and insight to
articulate their capacities as students of the humanities, and by
introducing them to pathways to meaningful professional life and
public service. “Humanists at Work” directly and productively
confronts the myth that the study of arts and humanities does not
prepare students for careers, and actively demonstrates the highly
desirable and highly transferable skills they gain as
humanists-in-training. The course will explore how skills like
critical thinking, analytic writing, persuasive speaking, original
research, and project-management translate into the workplace - be
it in private industry, public service, entrepreneurial ventures,
or the arts themselves. In revealing the broad array of careers and
meaningful work opportunities that are available to students, the
course endorses the passion, curiosity, and imagination that
inspired them to explore the arts and humanities in the first
place, and teach them how these qualities can result in substantial
contributions to the world.

The course is comprised of three elements - mentorship, career
readiness, and public service. For the mentorship portion of the
course, the instructor will invite Berkeley alumni at various
stages in their careers to talk about how their undergraduate
experiences in arts and humanities helped them become changemakers
beyond academia, how the skills they gained translated into
real-world practice, and how their values and commitments as
changemakers determine the qualities they seek in the people with
whom they collaborate.

For the career readiness weeks, the instructor will focus on those
skills that employers most seek and that are highly developed in
arts and humanities students: problem-solving, written and verbal
communication, analytic skills, leadership, and initiative. Resume
and interview guidance will help students learn how to tell their
stories and communicate their capacities as humanities students to
employers.

Finally, the public service section of the course will allow
students to explore many possibilities for meaningful public-facing
work that they can accomplish while still undergraduates. Working
in communities, schools, organizations, entrepreneurial projects,
or politics, students can find out how to bring their passions to
the world; learn from a vibrant and diverse range of people who are
addressing issues on local, national, and global scales; and
discover how to combine passion, talent, and hard work in ways that
allow them to develop leadership qualities of their own.

Georgia Southern University Libraries – Zach S. Henderson
Library

Georgia Southern University Libraries invites applications and
nominations for the position of Head of Research Services and
Tenure-Track Associate Professor or Professor. The home campus for
this position will be the Statesboro, GA campus.

Georgia Southern University is a distinctive combination of
Southern charm and uncompromising academics. We are a Carnegie
Doctoral/R2 institution serving about 26,500 students through nine
colleges on three beautiful oak-lined campuses in Statesboro,
Savannah, Hinesville, and via a growing online program. Throughout
its degree offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's, and
doctoral levels, Georgia Southern cultivates community
collaboration, world-class scholarship, and hands-on learning
opportunities.

Georgia Southern University was founded in 1906 as a school for
teaching modern agricultural production techniques and homemaking
skills to rural school children. Its Savannah campus was
established in 1935 as Armstrong Junior College for local youth who
could not afford to attend college away from home. The Liberty
Center in Hinesville was established in 1998 to serve the military
and their families at nearby Fort Stewart, the largest military
base east of the Mississippi. All three locations came together in
2018 when Armstrong State University and Georgia Southern
University consolidated. The ""new"" Georgia Southern University
preserves a passion for serving its neighbors while preparing
students for lifelong service as scholars, leaders, and responsible
stewards of their communities.

Believing that diversity contributes to excellence in the workplace
and to the quality of the University's academic environment, the
University Libraries are committed to recruiting and retaining a
diverse faculty to support, promote and serve a diverse student

minority communities. Faculty are expected to have an inclusive
stance on mentoring and advising that incorporates working with

graduate students.

interdisciplinary research and thus, all research areas within

In addition to a successful research program in chemistry and/or
biochemistry, candidates are expected to establish an impactful
record of teaching at the lower division, upper division, and/or
graduate-level courses in chemistry/biochemistry.

continue until positions are filled.

The following materials are required for all applicants: cover
letter, curriculum vitae, statement of research, statement of
teaching, statement of past experience in activities that promote
diversity and inclusion and/or plans to make future contributions
(examples can be found here https://dps.ucsd.edu/faculty/contributions-to-diversity-statements.html),
and up to five publications. Applicants should provide the names of
at least three references that can provide letters on their
behalf.

The University of California is committed to creating and
maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application,
and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through

University programs and activities can work and learn together in a
safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment,

Position description
The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in the Division of
Physical Sciences at the University of California, San Diego
(https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/) is seeking applications
for outstanding faculty at the Assistant Professor level. UC San
Diego is forging a new paradigm for engagement and collaboration
between STEM/Public Health/Health Sciences and the Social
Sciences/Arts & Humanities (https://af-amstudies.ucsd.edu/faculty-recruitment/index.html).
This faculty line is one of 13 ladder-rank faculty positions that
unites STEM/Public Health/Health Sciences departments and African
American and the Black Diaspora Studies through innovative
research, coordinated teaching, and/or targeted service. Faculty
will have multiple opportunities to engage with scholars across
UCSD disciplines to address issues of race and racism, access and
equity, and social and political influences focused on STEM/Public
Health/Health Sciences, while also working within their home
departments and professional communities.

Faculty holding these positions will be expected to design and
teach undergraduate courses that align with the African American
Studies Minor (AASM) and the Black Diaspora and African American
Studies Major. They may also demonstrate the equivalent through
service to the AASM and by mentoring undergraduate students, and/or
development of a course in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry that fulfills the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
requirement for undergraduate students. This instruction would be
part of the standard teaching load that includes regular courses in
Chemistry and/or Biochemistry (see below). We seek candidates whose
research, teaching, and/or service advance anti-racism,
anti-oppression, equity, and justice in STEM/Public Health/Health
Sciences. We welcome candidates whose experiences have facilitated
their understanding of traditionally underrepresented racial
minority communities. Faculty are expected to have an inclusive
stance on mentoring and advising that incorporates working with
women and underrepresented racial minority undergraduate and
graduate students.

The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has a rich history of
interdisciplinary research and thus, all research areas within
chemistry and biochemistry will be considered.

In addition to a successful research program in chemistry and/or

Position Announcement
The University of Oregon's School of Journalism and Communication
seeks a tenure-track Assistant Professor with a research and
teaching emphasis in the area of Digital Platforms and Ethics. We
seek to hire a colleague who will conduct research on and teach
ethics in the context of mass media, communication, and digital
media technologies—including internet platforms, software,
algorithms, and technical infrastructure. Apps, algorithms, and
digital platforms dominate much of our economy, politics, culture,
and everyday lives, with consequences for communication, mass
media, democracy, and public life. For example, the ascendancy of
Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft requires assessment
of issues ranging from bias built into software to monopolization
of online markets and even their role in the rise and spread of
misinformation around COVID-19, climate change, and recent
elections.

The hire would bring the following key contributions to our
faculty:

1) Expertise in theories and concepts pertinent to media ethics
generally and digital media ethics specifically, including issues
of free speech, privacy, surveillance, transparency, content
moderation, platform power, trust, misinformation, and/or human
rights;
2) A related specialty, such as the study of algorithms, software,
platforms and infrastructures, and/or critical approaches to
programming; and
3) A capacity to teach our required Media Ethics course, other core
courses (such as Media and Society and courses within our four
undergraduate and graduate sequences as related to their area(s) of
expertise), as well as develop innovative courses across the
SOJC.

This person must have a Ph.D. in communication, media studies,
journalism, information science/studies, philosophy, or another
related field in hand by time of appointment; demonstrated
potential for teaching excellence; ability to execute independent
and/or collaborative research that advances theory and bridges
knowledge and practice; and a record or promise of scholarly
accomplishment that includes publication of peer-reviewed articles
and publication in academic journals in communication, media
studies, journalism, information studies, surveillance studies,
and/or related fields.

This faculty hire will join our Media Studies area, which focuses
on three key areas: Media Technologies and Public Life, Media
Structures and Regulation, and Culture and Power in the Media.
Further, they should contribute to making the SOJC a destination
for graduate and undergraduate students to engage with and
understand the ethical, social, and cultural implications of
digital technologies. This hire would ideally strengthen SOJC's
ties to other units on campus, including existing collaborations
with CAS (e.g., the annual Data|Media|Digital Graduate Symposium),
the campus-wide New Media and Culture Certificate program for
graduate students, the ethics minor in philosophy, and UO's Data
Sciences Initiative, through a practical orientation to ethical
issues in society. Finally, the ideal candidate will have strong
potential to mentor undergraduate and graduate students as well as
strong potential for and commitment to contributing to a culture of
inclusive teaching and evidence of valuing diversity, equity, and
inclusion.

This position is based in Eugene.

Position Announcement
Scientific research has the power to make our lives better—but only
if we use it. The way the public engages with scientific
discoveries and information affects our ability to solve the most
pressing global issues, from climate change to public health. The
School of Journalism and Communication (SOJC) at the University of
Oregon (UO) invites applications for a tenure-track position for an
Assistant Professor in Science and Risk Communication with an
environmental focus to begin in fall 2022.

We seek a faculty member who will conduct innovative,
interdisciplinary science-communication research—focused on
environmental issues—to support evidence-based decision-making and
improve personal and societal welfare. This person must have a
Ph.D. in communication, psychology, or related field in hand by
time of appointment.

The successful candidate competencies include demonstrated
potential for teaching and research excellence; strong potential to
obtain external grants to advance theory and bridge knowledge and
practice; and a record of scholarly accomplishment that includes
publication in peer-reviewed articles and academic journals in
communication, psychology, and/or related field.

This hire is expected to have outstanding communication skills and
to build collaborations across UO including the SOJC, amplify the
SOJC's scholarly profile in environmental research, and help
advance our vision to become a national and international leader in
science-communication research. Thus, the hire will help to
consolidate the role and activities of the Center for Science
Communication Research (SCR) as UO's interdisciplinary and
transdisciplinary hub for science-and-risk-communication research
and teaching.

SCR's vision is to lead and teach about cutting-edge science
communication research that addresses complex problems and improves
evidence-based decision-making. Candidates whose research and
teaching programs focus on environmental science communication with
respect to communities affected by environmental injustice are
especially encouraged to apply. Effective science-communication
techniques also are needed across SOJC and UO to address current
issues of misinformation, fake news, and scientific and media
illiteracy that lives side-by-side with developing trends in SOJC
programs on brand responsibility and corporate activism. We are
looking for passionate researchers, professionals, and students to
join in advancing science communication for the benefit of our
communities. Our interdisciplinary team collaborates with faculty,
students, and businesses throughout Oregon and our nation. If you
share our enthusiasm for science and storytelling, let's
connect.

The person hired for this position will provide undergraduate
students in our science communication minor and graduate students
in our Communication and Media Studies Ph.D. program with a strong
theoretical background and practical experiences in the role and
impact of science communication. The hire will also be prepared to
offer courses to our diverse students that bridge academia and
practice and to develop a new curriculum, including
once-in-a-lifetime experiential learning opportunities, that
further positions the SOJC as a thought leader in science
communication.

This position will be based at the University of Oregon's Eugene
campus and will take a leading role in supporting and shaping the
center (SCR). This person will teach up to five courses per year
for undergraduate and graduate students in science communication
and either Public Relations or Advertising sequences. Specific
courses to be taught may include science of science communication
and special topics courses in the science of environmental science
communication and in public relations or advertising.

history at the University of Oregon, which is a comprehensive

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

The CSUSB Department of Music provides students with a rigorous

Consistent with the university's mission, the department is also

profession, become a professional musician, work in the music

education.

Many graduates of the department's Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of

arrangers, producers, and technicians in the entertainment

Liberal Studies courses provide elementary teachers with the
experience and knowledge necessary to make music an effective tool

job duties in the position being sought.

Please note: Current employees who are offered positions on campus
will be required to undergo a background check for any position
where a background check is required by law or that CSUSB has
designated as sensitive. Sensitive positions are those requiring
heightened scrutiny of individuals holding the position based on
potential for harm to children, concerns for the safety and
security of people, animals, or property, or heightened risk of
financial loss to CSUSB or individuals in the university
community.

campus. The university is committed to promoting a healthy
environment for all members of our community.

both of which prepare students for careers in government, the
private sector, non-profit work, or for graduate school. Our BA in

combines coursework in economics with coursework in related
disciplines, allowing students to investigate the effects of
gender, race, ethnicity, and class on the economy.
