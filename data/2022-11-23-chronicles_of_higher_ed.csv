TENURE TRACK POSITION in POPULATION MEDICINE, SUSTAINABLE
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY


Location: Kennett Square, PA
Open Date: Nov 17, 2022
Deadline:

The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine
invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position
(Assistant/Associate/Full Professor) within the Section of
Population Medicine in the 
Department of Clinical Studies-New Bolton Center. Professional
responsibilities will be divided between research (75%) and
academic duties (25%), including teaching of veterinary students,
interaction with stakeholders in the agricultural industry, and
contribution to the newly-formed Center for Stewardship Agriculture
and Food Security (CSAFS),
which was launched in October, 2022.

The candidate will join a vibrant team of faculty within the
Section performing innovative research in rumen microbial genomics
and methane mitigation, upcycling of discarded food for production
animal feedstuffs, animal health and productivity, reproduction,
agricultural animal behavior, welfare and wellbeing, geospatial
modeling of disease, biostatistics, food safety and antimicrobial
usage, and global food security and agricultural entrepreneurship.
The research team works closely with clinical production medicine
faculty within the Section, who perform field investigation with
dairy and swine farms within the local area, throughout the
Commonwealth and beyond.

The mission of the new CSAFS is to foster the responsible use of
agricultural and natural resources while feeding the world's
burgeoning population, with the aim of advancing farming practices
that will bolster sustainable development. The nascent CSAFS
provides the opportunity for interaction throughout the School via
collaboration with other departments and initiatives at Penn Vet
including 
Pathobiology, 
Wildlife Futures, and the 
Institute for Infectious and Zoonotic Disease; with initiatives
across the University, including the Kleinman Energy Center and
Department
of Landscape Architecture at the Weitzman School of Design, the
Penn Water Center,
the Wharton Business
School, the PRECISE
Center and the Clean
Energy Conversions Laboratory, both associated with the School
of Engineering and Applied Science, the Galapagos Education and
Research Alliance, and the Earth and Environmental Science
Department, both from the School of Arts and Science, as well
as Penn Global; and with
strategic agricultural and environmentally-focused entities in the
local, national and international communities.

As a tenure-track faculty member, the successful candidate will be
expected to develop an independent research program. Skills in
obtaining competitive extramural funding to sustain such research
are crucial. Additional expectations include active participation
in the Section's core teaching of nutritional, metabolic,
physiological, animal health and production, and/or epidemiological
concepts to veterinary students, with the option to develop new
elective coursework. The Section has a strong history of research
supporting the dairy industry, a major contributor to
Pennsylvania's economy, and we encourage applications from
candidates whose work will integrate new concepts and research
discoveries into solving issues related to dairy sustainability,
efficiency, environmental impact, and mitigation of carbon
footprint, including modeling of nutrient flows (nitrogen,
phosphorus, carbon) within the farm.

The successful candidate has the potential to access the clinical,
teaching and research units on the New Bolton Center Campus,
including the Veterinary School's 200-cow Marshak Dairy; the
250-sow Swine Teaching & Research Center; approximately 250
acres of crop and pasture land; and the facilities and expertise of
the internationally renowned New Bolton Center Hospital for Large
Animals. Laboratory space is available dependent on the
individual's programmatic needs.

New Bolton Center is located on 700 rolling acres in beautiful
Chester County, Pennsylvania, with easy access to numerous dairy
farms in southeastern Pennsylvania. The campus is only 35 miles
from Philadelphia, combining the advantages of a rural setting with
those of a nearby major metropolitan center.

We seek candidates who embrace and reflect diversity in the
broadest sense.


Qualifications
Applicants must hold a VMD/DVM or equivalent degree, and/or a PhD,
with advanced training in fields applicable to the balance between
environmental sustainability of farm animal agriculture and food
security. Preference will be given to candidates who will develop
their own investigative niche while contributing to collaborative
scholarship as an active member of the Section of Population
Medicine and the CSAFS.


Application Instructions
The deadline for application is December 31, 2022 or until the
position is filled. Questions about the position can be directed to
Dr. Andrew van Eps, Search Committee Chair; email vaneps@vet.upenn.edu; or Dr.

Description
The Department of Art and the History of Art invites applications
for a full-time tenure-track appointment at the rank of assistant
professor in sculpture. The appointment will begin on July 1, 2022.
Within the last decade, Amherst College has profoundly transformed
its student body in terms of socio-economic status, ethnicity,
race, and nationality. Today, nearly one-quarter of Amherst's
students are Pell grant recipients; 43 percent of our students are
domestic students of color; and 10 percent of our students are
international students. Our expectation is that the successful
candidate will excel at teaching and mentoring students who are
broadly diverse with regard to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, and
religion.

We seek a broad thinker and technically skilled artist who is
dedicated to teaching both established and experimental approaches
in sculpture at all levels. The ability and interest in
contributing to the teaching of fundamental departmental core
courses, such as drawing and design, for example, are
essential.

The ideal candidate will have an M.F.A. degree or the professional
equivalent, at least three years of teaching experience, an
established exhibition record, and be conversant in critical
discourses related to the history and practice of sculpture. We
will consider a broad range of applicants, including those working
in socially engaged or material-based practice; public art; object
making; installation; and other forms. We welcome candidates whose
work engages the complexities of the contemporary world. The
colleague we seek will expose students to historical and
contemporary art issues in sculpture, help students hone skills in
visual literacy and critical assessment, and challenge students to
develop strategies to realize interdisciplinary content in
inventive ways.

The position involves teaching four courses per year; engagement in
the life of the department and the college; advising students,
including advising senior honors projects; maintaining and building
an active exhibition record; overseeing the sculpture studios; and
working to foster a progressive atmosphere for exploring the arts
within a liberal arts college context.

Candidates are asked to send to https://apply.interfolio.com/87700
a CV, a letter of interest that summarizes the candidate's approach
to both artmaking and teaching, twenty images and/or videos of
work, two to three sample syllabi, up to twenty examples of student
work (if available), and the contact information for three to five
references. Review of applications will begin on October 25, 2021,
and continue until the position is filled.

persons of all genders, persons of color, and persons with
disabilities to apply. The college is committed to enriching its
educational experience and its culture through the diversity of its
faculty, administration, and staff.

Provost’s Fellow to Faculty Tenure-Track Position, Public Policy or Management, John Glenn College of Public Affairs.  The John Glenn College of Public Affairs invites applications from early career scholars for a tenure-track Fellow to Faculty position, with a focus on race, economic inequality, and public policy or management. We are interested in candidates with expertise at the nexus of racial and economic inequality broadly construed. Thematic areas of interest include, but are not limited to, inequalities in wealth, income, credit, and debt; social, political, and institutional determinants of economic inequality; and policy or management interventions that address or exacerbate economic inequality. We welcome scholars employing a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches, including but not limited to the analysis of large-N data, ethnography, experiments, and interpretive and critical research methods.
This position is part of the University’s Tenure-Track Fellow to Faculty and Race, Inclusion, and Social Equity (RAISE) Initiatives to enhance our world-class research program on race, inclusion, and social equity through recruitment of faculty whose research can help narrow racial and economic disparities. This position will be part of a cluster hire of three faculty members focused on Race, Economic Equity, and Financial Inclusion across the Life Course in the following units: The John Glenn College of Public Affairs, Economics, and Sociology. Building on established interdisciplinary collaborations and unique administrative data infrastructure at Ohio State in the study of economic disparities across the life course, the cluster hires will accelerate progress in documenting, understanding, and addressing entrenched racial disparities in financial resources and economic opportunity. OSU’s many departments and centers, especially the Institute for Population Research, the Center for Human Resources Research (CHRR), the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, and the Center for Ethnic Studies present opportunities for rich collaboration and scholarly community across disciplines.
The goal of the Provost’s Fellow to Faculty Program is to recruit early-career scholars whose accomplishments make them exceptionally competitive for faculty positions. Provost Fellows will focus full-time on research for up to two years allowing for an in-depth start on scholarship, with limited teaching requirements (although Fellows may teach one course per year if they choose). Following the two-year tenure-track fellowship period, the Fellow will automatically transfer to the rank of assistant professor and the tenure clock will begin. During the fellowship period, Fellows receive research funding and participate in career development programs to support their transition to assistant professor and their long-term career success. In addition, Provost Fellows will participate in the scholarly activities within the John Glenn College of Public Affairs and have a designated faculty mentor. After the Fellow transitions to an assistant professor line, the recruited candidate will be expected to maintain a robust research program, contribute to excellence in graduate and undergraduate teaching and mentoring, and provide service to the university and the profession. Scholars who can work collaboratively within a multidisciplinary team are of particular interest, as are those who can engage with other programs and interdisciplinary research centers at the university, and who have potential to pursue research funding.
The successful Fellow candidate should demonstrate (1) a compelling research agenda focused on race, economic inequality, and public policy or management, (2) potential for high-quality teaching and mentoring of students from diverse backgrounds, and (3) a demonstrated commitment to inclusion and diversity.
 
Additional Information
The position will begin in the Fall of 2023. Salary will be commensurate with the candidate’s experience and qualifications. Applicants must have completed all doctoral degree requirements by the time of their appointment. Successful candidates will likely have doctorates in relevant fields such as public administration, public affairs, public policy, economics, consumer sciences, political science, or sociology, and a demonstrated commitment toward social equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Questions regarding the position may be sent to the search committee chair, Stephanie Moulton.

endowment, the mission of Halicioglu Data Science Institute is to
explore the scientific foundations for the new field of data
science. These foundations include both the principles, methods,
and tools that will enable us to understand the nature of digital
data and also the intersections between the new field of Data
Science and existing disciplines of human inquiry. HDSI is a new
strategic academic institute tasked with hosting and coordinating
data science research and education activities at the University of
California, San Diego. We are currently looking for faculty
appointments at all levels to build the core faculty of the
Institute with the following search focus areas.

Candidates must submit their application to one of the following
three (3) broad areas of this search:

o

Data Science Theoretical Foundations

We seek faculty applicants who apply their disciplinary skills to
advance the theory and applications of data science. The scope
includes the fundamental theory, techniques, methods, and
algorithms underlying data science applications in various domains.
The foundation's area draws heavily from traditional disciplines
such as machine learning, statistics, optimization, signal
processing, algorithms, and complexity. Accordingly, ideal
candidates will have a doctorate in computer science, engineering,
or mathematics/statistics and a record of research in foundations
of data sciences.

o

Data Science Systems and Applications
We seek faculty candidates with background and experience in
building data science systems (including architectural design, data
mining, database systems, hardware, and software implementations)
that target a well-defined application area. Examples of
application areas include robotics, health, and cyber-physical
systems. Research topics may include architectural design and
implementation of devices and systems that push the state of the
art in the use of data, data models, data-related workflows, and
methods of artificial intelligence. Demonstrated applications of
these advances in targeted areas are of special interest. System
implementations that target cross-cutting needs such as data
visualization, and system security are particularly welcome to
apply. Accordingly, ideal candidates will have a doctorate in
sciences or engineering with a record of research in data
sciences.

o

Data Science and Society
We seek faculty candidates with a background in computer science
and social sciences who explore the impact of risks and benefits of
digital data for a well-defined vertical: such as democratic
practice, health, education, trade in digital services, or societal
infrastructure for energy, transportation, and communications or
information infrastructures. Of prime interest will be candidates
pursuing advances in theory, methods, and tools that help us
understand security risks to organizations and the national
infrastructure, and devise methods and policies to mitigate those
risks considering both technical considerations and implementation
factors such as social, political and economic feasibility.

Successful applicants will be expected to teach graduate and
undergraduate students in the Data Science major/minor degree
programs offered by the Institute. All candidates are expected to
establish a vigorous program of high-quality, federally-funded
research that focuses on innovations in one of the targeted search
areas. Salary is commensurate with qualifications and based on
University of California pay scales.

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS (required at time of application)

PhD/equivalent or Advancement to Candidacy by time of
application.

Richard E. and Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow
Position in Environmental Engineering at Bucknell
University

Job No: 497181
Position Type: full-time
Location: Lewisburg, PA
Categories: Civil & Environmental Engineering

The Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department at
Bucknell University invites applications for a Richard E. and
Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow position in
Environmental Engineering, starting in August 2023. The Smith PTT
Fellowship Program promotes pedagogical and institutional
excellence through diversification of faculty and curricula at the
University. Richard and Yvonne Smith were people of great
intellectual curiosity and humility, with uplifting and encouraging
spirits and a generous hospitality that was a foundation for
promoting inclusion and belonging at Bucknell. They reached out to
and engaged with students and colleagues in ways that left a
profound and positive impact on the institution. In that spirit, we
are seeking candidates from diverse backgrounds who have an active
intellectual life that they wish to share with the Bucknell
community. Candidates from groups underrepresented among faculty in
higher education are strongly encouraged to apply, and we hope that
you will. It would be a privilege to learn more about you, and we
would like for you to get to know us as well!

The CEE Department at Bucknell offers B.S. and M.S. degree programs
in civil engineering (CENG) and environmental engineering (EVEG).
The Department's mission is to prepare the next generation of
leaders in the stewardship of our natural and built environments,
for the benefit of the planet, communities, and people. The
hallmarks of a Bucknell CEE education include outstanding teaching,
small class sizes, hands-on and experiential learning, close
interaction with approachable faculty and staff, and opportunities
for undergraduates to conduct research with faculty. In addition,
through this advertised position and other efforts, the Department
is striving to create an inclusive and supportive community in
which all voices are valued and respected, diverse perspectives are
embraced, and students, faculty, and staff of all backgrounds and
identities can thrive.

For this position, we seek individuals with broad teaching and
scholarly interests in the area of environmental engineering and
who wish to cultivate and develop these interests with support and
mentoring. Candidates must have a doctorate in environmental
engineering, or a closely related engineering field, at the time of
appointment. Candidates are asked to convey in their application
materials an enthusiasm for undergraduate teaching, a commitment to
inclusive teaching practices in the classroom and laboratory, and
an interest in establishing a productive research program. We are
seeking an individual with teaching interests to support the EVEG
curriculum, as well as scholarly interests that complement our
current capabilities. This position is ideal for candidates who are
excited about working to enhance established strengths of the
University, examples of which include research involving
undergraduates, collaboration within and across departments and
colleges, community engagement, and others.

The successful candidate will spend one or two years as a Smith PTT
Fellow at Bucknell, bringing new perspectives and contemporary
knowledge and participating in campus life. The Fellow will receive
mentoring, a reduced teaching load, resources for scholarship,
travel, and professional development, and other support that will
help them a) better understand the nature of a career as a
teacher-scholar at a predominantly undergraduate institution; b)
develop and strengthen their pedagogical skills and experience; and
c) establish and enhance their research trajectory. The Fellow will
have the opportunity to engage in innovative teaching and
scholarship within our excellent facilities, including the
University's Environmental Engineering and Science Laboratory
(EESL). At the end of the fellowship period, and with positive
evaluations, the Fellow will transition into a tenure-track faculty
position at Bucknell.

Application materials must include the following five documents: 1)
a cover letter that clearly summarizes the candidate's interest in
Bucknell and in this position; 2) a current curriculum vitae; 3) a
teaching statement that conveys the candidate's interest in
undergraduate teaching, describes the candidate's ideas or
philosophy for equitable and inclusive teaching, and identifies the
courses within the EVEG curriculum to which the candidate could
contribute (3 pages maximum); 4) a scholarship statement addressing
the candidate's plans for scholarly work at Bucknell and how that
work may include undergraduates, if applicable (2 pages maximum);
and 5) contact information for at least three potential references
(letters may be requested by the search committee). Applications
will only be accepted online through Bucknell's career site
(careers.bucknell.edu). Review of applications is ongoing
and will continue until the position is filled.
Interested individuals may contact the Chair of the search
committee, Kevin Gilmore (kevin.gilmore@bucknell.edu), with any
questions you may have or to convey your interest in the position
and intent to apply.

Framingham State University was founded in 1839 for a singular
purpose - meeting a public need to promote the public good. At our
founding as the nation's first public normal school, that need was
for comprehensively educated public school teachers who would, in
turn, promote an educated citizenry. FSU continues to offer
exceptional teacher education programs and, while we are proud of
our roots as a teachers' college, we have grown far beyond them.
Public need continues to evolve and FSU right along with it. Our
students and alumni are making waves in the fashion industry,
designing nutrition plans for professional athletes, writing for
major media and news organizations, and working for Fortune 500
companies right here in Framingham. FSU is unapologetically a
public institution offering accessible, affordable educational
opportunities that integrate an academically challenging liberal
arts education with workforce preparation programs, in a highly
personalized teaching environment. Our programs have expanded but
our purpose and commitment to public education for the public good
remain steadfast.
At FSU, we are deeply committed to inclusive excellence and
strive to promote a culture of antiracism, encouraging a
challenging yet collaborative learning environment, and providing
culturally relevant education. FSU is designated as an emerging
Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Hispanic Association of
Colleges and Universities and also belongs to the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute (HHMI) Inclusive Excellence community, providing
national leadership in science education and exploring strategies
that will lead to more inclusive science education. We are honored
that our commitment earned FSU six Higher Education Excellence in
Diversity (HEED) Awards from INSIGHT Into Diversity. We encourage
applications from those who share our commitment to promoting a
diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community.
FSU currently enrolls about 3,000 undergraduate and 1,000
graduate and professional students, offers 39 undergraduate majors,
and enrolls 41% BIPOC students in our undergraduate programs.
Ideally situated between Boston and Worcester, FSU and the
surrounding area are steeped in history, achievement, and
innovation and provide access to urban hotspots, verdant
landscapes, natural and cultural amenities, and diverse
communities.
Our founding motto, LIVE TO THE TRUTH, was said at the end of
each class by beloved first principal, Cyrus Peirce, who sought to
discover and teach ""truth in theory and principle...truth in spirit
and motive...truth in manner and form...truth intellectual and
truth moral."" Early leaders found this motto ""speaks of sincerity
of spirit...of intensity of effort, of resolution to succeed, of
joy in achievement."" LIVE TO THE TRUTH aptly reflects our past and
our pledge for the future as it continues to guide our institution
in practice and endeavor. If you share in this quest for truth and
a commitment to living it fully, make the next chapter of your
career the best chapter at Framingham State University.

ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY

The Center for Drug Discovery (CDD) at Northeastern University
invites applications for two junior (at the rank of Tenure-Track
Assistant Professor) and two senior (at the rank of Tenure-on-Entry
Associate or Full Professor) positions with projected start dates
in 2023. The mission of the CDD is to engage in drug discovery and
development that will lead to new medications to satisfy a variety
of unmet medical needs, particularly involving brain disorders,
infectious diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. To accomplish
this, the CDD is directed to develop novel methodologies to improve
drug discovery. Junior scientists using breakthrough technologies
are welcome to apply as are senior faculty with internationally
recognized programs and strong funding, whose expertise will
complement activities of faculty affiliated with the CDD toward
drug discovery. Because of the scope of the CDD it is likely the
primary appointment of successful candidates might be in the
Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Bouve College of Health
Sciences. However, department fit within Bouve College or across
other colleges at Northeastern University (such as the College of
Science, the College of Engineering, or the Khoury College of
Computer Sciences) will be discussed with candidates and determined
accordingly. Cross-disciplinary research programs and appointments
are strongly encouraged by Northeastern University.

The CDD was founded in 2003 by Alexandros Makriyannis, who is the
Director and Behrakis Chair in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology with
joint appointments in Pharmaceutical Sciences (Bouve) and Chemistry
and Chemical Biology (College of Science). His research interests
lie in the cannabinoid system and drugs of abuse. In 2012, Raymond
Booth joined Northeastern as the Associate Director of the CDD. His
research interests lie in neuropsychiatric disorders focusing on
metabotropic serotonin receptors and his academic appointments are
in the departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences as well as Chemistry
and Chemical Biology. In 2016, Diomedes Logothetis joined
Northeastern and the CDD as a member. His research interests lie in
ion channels and G protein coupled receptors serving as specific
drug targets and his academic appointment is in the department of
Pharmaceutical Sciences. He is also affiliated with the department
of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and the Roux Institute in
Portland, Maine. In 2021, the CDD doubled its faculty with three
additional members. Roman Manetsch joined the departments of
Chemistry and Chemical Biology as well as Pharmaceutical Sciences
in 2014 and his research interests lie in the medicinal chemistry
of anti-infectives, particularly as they apply to neglected
parasitic diseases. Leigh Plant joined the department of
Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2020 and his research interests lie in
mechanisms of hypoxic control of ion channels and G protein-coupled
receptors. Hideaki Yano joined the department of Pharmaceutical
Sciences in 2020 and his research interests lie in studies of
ligands of G protein coupled receptors which employ biased
signaling and allosterism and could be useful in neuropsychiatric
illnesses. The four additional positions to be filled will bring
the CDD faculty to a membership of ten scientists with a keen
common interest in pre-clinical and translational drug
discovery.

One key direction of the CDD is to collaborate intensively with the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries of Norstheastern's
global university system.

The Bouve College of Health Sciences is organized in four
Schools: Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences comprising
two departments that include Pharmaceutical Sciences (running this
search as the leading department for the academic appointment of
CDD faculty); Community Health and Behavioral Sciences
comprising two departments; Clinical and Rehabilitation
Sciences comprising three departments; and
Nursing.

The College of Science comprises six departments: Biology,
Chemistry and Chemical Biology (the second department in
which CDD members hold academic appointments), Marine and
Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and
Psychology.

The College of Engineering comprises five departments:
Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil and
Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, Mechanical and Industrial
Engineering.

The Khoury College of Computer Sciences encompasses multiple areas
of research such as: Algorithms & Theory, Artificial
Intelligence, Computational Biology, Data
Science, Data Visualization, Formal Methods,
Games, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning,
Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval,
Network Science, Personal Health Informatics,
Programming Languages, Robotics, Security and
Privacy, Software Engineering, Systems and
Networking.

The CDD provides a great environment to train junior faculty,
students and postdoctoral fellows in the art and science of drug
discovery. In fact, this has been recognized by the National
Institutes of Drug Abuse with a T32 training grant awarded to the
CDD to train three graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows.
Trainees of CDD members compete for available slots in the training
grant and bring the support of the T32 award to their lab.

Northeastern is home to the Biopharmaceutical Analysis
Training Laboratory (BATL), Coastal
Sustainability Institute, the Global Resilience
Institute, the Barnett Institute for
Chemical and Biological Analysis, the Institute for Chemical Imaging of
Living Systems, the Network
Science Institute, the Northeastern
University Center for Renewable Energy Technology, an NSF Frontier Center in Theoretical
Biological Physics, the Center for
Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems, and the Life Sciences Testing Center,
providing a rich multidisciplinary intellectual environment.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork. Hires will be mentored for success, with mentoring teams
and group guidance. In addition, a strong and effective faculty
development strategy is part of the Northeastern institutional
mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development works in
conjunction with the Office of Research Development (ORD), the
Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion (OIDI), the Center
for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and
University Decision Support (UDS) to provide programs and trainings
to further develop and support a thriving faculty.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations. Opportunities to collaborate extend
beyond the University.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each
