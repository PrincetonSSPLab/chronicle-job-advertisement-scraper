JOB SUMMARY

The Department of Philosophy at California State University, San
Bernardino, is hiring a full-time, academic-year, tenure-track
Assistant Professor. The area of specialization is Ancient Greek or
Roman Philosophy. The area of concentration may be anything that
will help the department diversify its course offerings and which
does not overlap with areas our current tenure-line faculty teach.
We are especially interested in candidates who could offer courses
in one or more of Africana (African, African American), East Asian,
Indigenous American, Islamic, South Asian, and other less commonly
taught philosophies. Since almost all our department's courses are
designated “Writing Intensive,” preference will be given to
candidates who demonstrate commitment to and success in helping
undergraduates develop as writers.

TYPICAL ACTIVITIES

The successful candidate will teach undergraduate classes for the
university's General Education program and for the Philosophy
major. Most Philosophy courses are capped at 28 students. The
typical teaching load is 4-4 with 2 preparations (when possible,
three sections of one General Education course and one section of
an upper division course for majors). Note that pre-tenure faculty
are given several course releases and can apply for internal grants
to get others. Service responsibilities in the department,
including academic advising for our majors, are shared equally
among all tenure-line faculty. To earn tenure, the candidate must
also demonstrate increasingly intensive service at the college and
university level. The department and the university expect the
successful candidate to undertake a meaningful program of original
research as part of achieving tenure and maintaining currency in
the field.

Candidates must demonstrate a commitment to excellence in teaching
and mentoring a diverse student population and to working
effectively with faculty, staff and students across a wide range of
disciplines.

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS
Doctorate in Philosophy by the time of appointment (candidates
who are ABD at the time of application may be considered).
Research specialization in Ancient Greek or Roman
Philosophy.
Evidence of ability to teach advanced undergraduate courses in
Ancient Philosophy (Greek, Roman, or both).
Evidence of ability to teach introductory and General Education
courses in Philosophy that expand and diversify the department's
current course offerings. We are especially interested in
candidates who could offer courses in one or more of African,
African American, East Asian, Indigenous American, Islamic, South
Asian, and other less commonly taught philosophies.
Evidence of commitment to teaching/mentoring students from
diverse backgrounds and preparations.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS

Evidence of successful experience teaching Philosophy to
undergraduates, especially students who are first in their families
to attend college.
Evidence of expertise and success in teaching undergraduates to
write philosophy papers.
Advanced reading knowledge of Greek and/or Latin.


SPECIAL CONDITIONS

The person holding this position is considered a 'mandated
reporter' under the California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting
Act and is required to comply with the requirements set forth in
CSU Executive Order 1083 as a condition of employment.

Following a conditional offer of employment, a background check
(including a criminal records check) must be completed
satisfactorily before any candidate may start work with CSUSB.
Failure to satisfactorily complete the background check may result
in the withdrawal of the offer of employment. Note: CSUSB cannot
deny an applicant a position solely or in part due to a criminal
conviction history until it has performed an individualized
assessment and linked the relevant conviction history with specific
job duties in the position being sought.

Please note: Current employees who are offered positions on campus
will be required to undergo a background check for any position
where a background check is required by law or that CSUSB has
designated as sensitive. Sensitive positions are those requiring
heightened scrutiny of individuals holding the position based on
potential for harm to children, concerns for the safety and
security of people, animals, or property, or heightened risk of
financial loss to CSUSB or individuals in the university
community.

For health and well-being, CSUSB is a smoke & tobacco-free
campus. The university is committed to promoting a healthy
environment for all members of our community.

Position Description


The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications
for a position at the Assistant Professor rank. We seek candidates
with a strong background in computer science and engineering,
focusing on experimental computer systems, including but not
limited to operating systems, distributed systems, storage systems,
cloud computing systems, mobile systems, systems security, and
database systems. We are especially interested in candidates who
can collaborate within the department and across the
university.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is part of the
Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. UC Santa Cruz is a
member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an
association of the top research universities in the U.S. Our school
has nationally and internationally known researchers in many areas,
including theoretical computer science, programming languages,
security, distributed systems, storage systems, computer
architectures, machine learning, natural language processing,
vision, VLSI, and networking. The Baskin School of Engineering is
home to six departments, contributing to the richness of its
research. Nestled in a redwood forest above the city of Santa Cruz,
our beautiful campus has a long history of embracing groundbreaking
interdisciplinary work. Of the ten University of California
campuses, UCSC is the nearest to Silicon Valley and has close
research ties with the local computer industry. Our proximity to
Silicon Valley, and our satellite campus there, afford
opportunities and avenues for collaboration with researchers
working in the many research and development labs in Silicon
Valley, as well as with the other San Francisco Bay Area
universities.

The selected candidate is expected to develop a research program,
advise graduate students in their research area, obtain external
funding, develop and teach courses within the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, perform university, public and professional
service, and interact broadly with the large number of researchers
in Silicon Valley industrial research and advanced development
labs. The position requires that the appointed faculty member
successfully work with students, faculty, and staff from various
social and cultural backgrounds, genders, and sexual
orientations.

We are especially interested in candidates who can contribute to
the diversity and excellence of our academic community through
their research, teaching, and service. We welcome candidates who
understand the barriers facing women and minoritized groups who are
underrepresented in higher education careers (as evidenced by life
experiences and educational background), and who have experience in
equity and diversity with respect to teaching, mentoring, research,
life experiences, or service towards building an equitable and
diverse scholarly environment.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

Program Description:
Emerson's nationally recognized Writing Studies Program was awarded
the CCCC Writing Program Certificate of Excellence in 2013. The
program provides a required two-course sequence of first-year
writing classes designed to enable undergraduate students to write
competently and effectively in a range of modes. WR101:
Introduction to College Writing focuses on cultural analysis that
appears in academic work and in the public intellectual sphere.
WR121: Research Writing explores how rhetorical situations call on
writers to do research and how writers draw on various types of
writing to present the results of their research. Additional
emphasis is placed on training and mentoring graduate student
instructors, through the pedagogy seminar WR600: Teaching College
Composition, a weekly practicum, and regular professional
development workshops. The Writing Studies Program at Emerson is an
intellectually lively and socially engaged environment with
longstanding commitments to community writing and publishing
projects, translingual writing and teaching, and connections
between rhetoric and composition and creative writing and
publishing.

Duties:

courses for undergraduate students and a pedagogy seminar for
graduate students, mentoring graduate student instructors (who are
MFA students in creative writing and MA students in publishing),
collaboratively developing curriculum, and participating in the
collaborative leadership of the program. Other opportunities within

Literature, and Publishing will reflect candidates' areas of
interest and expertise as well as circumstantial curricular
needs.

Qualifications:
A PhD in rhetoric and composition or in a related area with
significant experience in rhetoric and composition is required. The
successful candidates will demonstrate their ability to work
effectively with faculty, students, and staff from diverse
backgrounds. Candidates should have a record of successful
college-level teaching and of ongoing scholarship, publication,
and/or practice. Expertise in translingualism with a readiness to
teach international student-focused course sections as well as
mentor other instructors of those sections, and in Writing Across
the Curriculum/Writing in the Disciplines, will be of particular
interest. Strengths in comparative and inclusive rhetorics,
anti-racist pedagogy, multimodality and digital literacy, community
writing and publishing, and intersections with creative writing or
literary study are also especially suited to the
intellectual/curricular work of the program.

The successful candidate must hold a PhD in Kinesiology or
related field, and demonstrate excellence or the potential for
excellence in teaching, research, and scholarship. The successful

especially with sociohistorical perspectives on race,
ethics and physical culture – including perspectives on

This includes a focus on race, Indigeneity and social justice in
the Canadian context. In linking race, ethics and physical culture,
the successful candidate would be well-positioned to teach about
and study the processes through which particular values come to be
associated with particular bodies, how these values are expressed
through the notion of race, how better understanding these
processes can aid understandings of (in)equity, inclusion and
exclusion, and ways to identify and address forms of racism. By
considering the physical body as a social and cultural entity, as
well as a biological one, the successful candidate would be well
positioned to study systemic forms of exclusion in relation to
racialized bodies, intersectional forms of discrimination, as well
as forms of resistance and social change – with particular
attention to sport, physical activity and health in local and
global contexts. Successful candidates would also be well
positioned to engage with anti-racist, anti-colonial, decolonizing,
and Indigenous resurgence approaches to race, Indigeneity and
social justice.
 
The advertised position aligns with priorities outlined in the
School of Kinesiology’s Strategic Plan and specifically advances
the mission to further interdisciplinary knowledge that enhances
opportunities for engagement in physical activity, health practices
and sport (collectively ‘physical culture’) for diverse individuals
and communities. The socio-cultural area in the School of
Kinesiology includes researchers with expertise in (in)equity,
power relations and culture in relation to health, sport, and human
movement. The School of Kinesiology is also home to a robust
research culture in Indigenous studies in kinesiology.
 
The successful candidate is expected to establish a program of
original, externally funded research (e.g., Tri-Council,
foundation, and partnership grants), and teach undergraduate and
graduate courses in the School/Faculty. The successful candidate
will also contribute to the growth of the School through
supervision of graduate students, participation in service
activities within the School, Faculty, University and in the
broader scholarly community, and collaboration with scholars within
the School and across Faculties at UBC.
 
The School of Kinesiology currently has 26 full-time tenure
stream faculty members, 1350 full-time undergraduate students, and
190 graduate students. The School offers a Bachelor of Kinesiology
degree with specializations in Neuromechanical and Physiological

interest in cross-media production, collaboration and community
engagement. The department has inter-divisional ties with units
like Ethnic Studies, Critical Gender Studies, and
Communication.

We are looking for a colleague to participate in growing an
innovative and exciting cross-genre MFA program, leading
cross-genre workshops, developing courses and curriculum, mentoring
across genres, collaborating in the graduate admissions process and
helping to coordinate the New Writers Series of readings affiliated

The Bissett School of Business at Mount Royal University invites
applications for a Tier II Canada Research Chair (CRC) in the area
of global value chain. The successful applicant will also hold a
tenure-track/tenured position at the rank of Assistant or Associate
Professor. The position will commence July 1, 2022, subject to
final budgetary approval.
 
The CRC in Global Value Chain will contribute to the Department
of International Business and Supply Chain Management. Our research
program is industry focused and is grounded in our BBA majors in
Supply Chain Management and International Business. The supply
chain major contains 10 core courses, is highly integrated with our
CN Supply Chain Data Analytics Lab, and offers a co-op education
opportunity. More information about the BBA and IBSC major can be
found here: (https://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/Business/index.htm).
The program is deeply rooted in applied learning, accredited with
the Canadian Supply Chain Research Foundation and heavily involved
with highly regarded networks in both industry and academic
communities.
 
“International production, trade and investments are
increasingly organized within global value chains (GVCs) where the
different stages of the production process are located across
different countries” (OECD - www.oecd.org). As such, the academic
study of GVCs can be from the perspective of international
strategy, supply chain management, logistics, and data
analytics. 
 
The successful applicant will have demonstrated evidence of a
sustained and productive emerging world-class research program.
Applicants must present evidence of a strong publication record in
global supply chain management, as well as a demonstrated ability
to attract peer-reviewed funding. The program of research will be
linked to the International Business & Supply Chain Management
department within the Bissett School of Business.  Research
would ideally address substantive challenges in global supply chain
competitiveness in a post pandemic world. This should be coupled
with advanced data analytics.  A long-term goal for this
position is to foster multidisciplinary research that links the
School and industry, while intentionally integrating an
international, intercultural or global dimension into the work and
student interactions.
 
The successful applicant’s research program, while requiring
independent work, should also have a collaborative component that
will engage and mentor MRU students, faculty members across
disciplines, government stakeholders, and industry and community
partners. The candidate will be expected to propose an original,
innovative research program of high quality that demonstrates the
potential to achieve international recognition in the next five to
10 years.
