Position Summary:
The College of Engineering and Computer Science (CoECS) at
Arkansas State University (A-State) invites applications for the
position of director of a new Bachelor of Science program in Data
Science & Data Analytics (DSDA). This program will be launched
in the Fall 2021. The position of director is a nine-month (with
possible summer compensation) appointment beginning in Spring
2022.

The DSDA is a joint program involving six colleges: College of
Agriculture, College of Education & Behavioral Science, College
of Engineering & Computer Science, College of Liberal Arts
& Communication, College of Nursing & Health Professions,
and College of Sciences & Mathematics. The DSDA program
includes various domains – either disciplinary or thematic in
nature -- supported by the participating colleges. Domains that
have been approved for the 2021-2022 academic year are in Health
Care, Engineering, Computer Science, Social Data Analytics and
Geospatial Technology. Examples of some domains under development
are in thematic areas such as bioinformatics, sustainability and
renewable energy. An undergraduate certificate in Data Analytics is
also part of the program and is open to all majors (except those in
DSDA). The new program follows closely on the heels of a new Center
for No Boundary Thinking that was established in the College of
Engineering and Computer Science to focus on research in Artificial
Intelligence.

Recognizing the importance of big data, the governor of Arkansas
commissioned a Blue Ribbon Commission to report on the Economic
Competitiveness of Computing and Data Analytics. The report has led
to the creation of the Arkansas Center for Data Sciences (ACDS) as
well as a groundswell of activity to develop data science and data
analytics programs to address the needs of the workforce in the
state. Another report from the Governor’s Arkansas Economic
Recovery TaskForce, among other recommendations, suggests that the
number of data science graduates in Arkansas needs to be more than
doubled in ten years (Section 1 of the Executive Summary). Further,
the National Science Foundation has funded a $24 million NSF-EPSCoR
DART project in data science and analytics. The DSDA program is a
direct response to the aforementioned priorities in the state. The
highly interdisciplinary nature of the program also delivers on the
Goal of Teaching and Learning in the newly developed Discover 2025:
Arkansas State University Strategic Plan.

This program will be housed in the College of Engineering and
Computer Science. The CoECS offers ABET-accredited undergraduate
degrees in the areas of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical
Engineering, and Civil Engineering, as well as master’s degrees in
Engineering Management, Engineering, and Computer Science, and
undergraduate degrees in Engineering Technology and Computer
Science. The university’s location in Northeast Arkansas provides
opportunities for partnerships with industry/employers in software
development, networks/communication, manufacturing,
agriculture/food production, steel, health care, education, and
other sectors of the economy.
Duties & Responsibilities:
 
The program director will serve as the program lead and primary
point of contact.  He/she is responsible for providing
leadership and working as part of an inter-collegiate,
inter-disciplinary team to coordinate the priorities of the
program, college, and the university.  The ideal candidate
will be comfortable with and will look forward to working with
colleagues in a very diverse academic setting to advance the Data
Science and Data Analytics program within the university
The successful candidate is also expected to continue or develop
a strong research portfolio in data science or related fields,
teach a variety of courses in the program such as data mining, data
visualization and design of experiments, advise and mentor
students, serve on various committees, and participate in
recruiting and outreach activities. The program director is also
expected to be the instructor of record for seminar, internship and
capstone design courses
In addition, the successful candidate will be expected to
collaborate with state agencies and universities, such as working
with ACDS to build a data science workforce in Arkansas and
participating in the EPSCoR DART Education Research Theme that
focuses on the state-wide effort to spread Data Science and Data
Analytics education within the state

374683,Multicultural Postdoctoral Fellow in Criminology and Criminal Justice,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/374683/multicultural-postdoctoral-fellow-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/,False,University of Rhode Island,"Rhode Island, United States",Salary Commensurate with experience,2021-08-27,"
Position is full-time academic year, limited to 05/21/2022 with
anticipated renewal.
The Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University
of Rhode Island seeks to hire a Distinguished Multicultural
Postdoctoral Faculty Fellow for the 2022-2023 academic year. The
Fellow will transition into a full-time, funded, tenure-track
position at the level of Assistant Professor at the end of the
first year, subject to a favorable review of teaching and scholarly
activities within the first twelve months.
This position is part of a Social Science Diversity &
Justice cluster hire and a larger set of coordinated diversity and
inclusion initiatives sponsored by the Provost’s office (https://web.uri.edu/provost/files/Agenda-for-MuChange-2021.Final_.pdf).
The goal of the fellowship is to support emerging outstanding
scholars from historically underrepresented groups interested in
pursuing a tenure-track faculty position. The cluster hire includes
three postdoctoral positions:
 -A sociologist specializing in race/ethnicity studies,
racialization, and/or racial inequality (housed in the Sociology
& Anthropology Department).
-An anthropologist specializing in the Indigenous peoples of the
Americas (housed in the Sociology & Anthropology Department;
this position was filled in July 2021).
-A scholar of crime/criminal justice (housed in the
interdisciplinary Criminology and Criminal Justice Program).
We aim to hire a cohort of scholar-teachers that excel in
academic and/or public scholarship and to facilitate mentorship and
professional development towards a tenure track position. We view
mentorship as a multidimensional and reciprocal process. As such,
the three postdoctoral fellows will be able to form a peer
mentoring group, will have campus offices in the same building, and
will have opportunities for collaboration with faculty in home and
other departments, such as Africana Studies and Gender and Women’s
Studies. The cluster hire’s focus on diversity and justice relates
directly to the goals of the Department of Sociology &
Anthropology, the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program, the
College of Arts & Sciences, and the wider University. For more
information, see: 
https://web.uri.edu/artsci/news/uri-to-hire-three-distinguished-multicultural-postdoctoral-fellows/.
While the area of expertise is open, candidates whose research
show promise in engaging with one of the following subfields will
be given priority: carceral studies; comparative criminology;
crimmingration; criminological theory; juvenile justice; program
evaluation; queer criminology; transformative justice; and
victimology. As an interdisciplinary program that offers our majors
elective options from across the College of Arts and Sciences,
candidates from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives will be
considered.
We seek a scholar-teacher who is committed to the University of
Rhode Island’s mission as a learner-centered research university
where diversity, fairness, and respect are valued. The ideal
candidate would be adept at engaging and supporting students from a
variety of backgrounds. We strongly encourage applications from
individuals who are under-represented across race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, disability, veteran status, sexual
orientation, gender identity, or any other legally protected
basis.
The postdoctoral fellow would be expected to teach courses on
criminology and/or criminal justice topics, advance their research
agenda and contribute to program, college, and university service.
The teaching load during the year of this fellowship is 1:1. The
transition to a tenure-track faculty position will be based on
continued interest on the part of the Fellow as well as the
potential of the Fellow to contribute to the teaching, scholarship,
and service needs and goals of the department as judged by the
departmental faculty and Dean of the College. If the Fellow does
not transition to a tenure-track position, the University is
committed to providing a second year of support in the postdoctoral
fellowship position.
