UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the
city of Bemidji — named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung
(nicknamed Bemidji) — is home to a diverse population of more than
15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than
100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

Diversity and inclusion are defining features of California's
past, present, and future. Increasing the diversity of our
educators to better reflect the population of California is just
one aspect of the College of Education's dedication to just,
equitable and inclusive education. Diversity refers to the variety
of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from
differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include
race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language,
abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
geographic region, and more. All College of Education students
leave with a perspective that recognizes, honors, and respects the
knowledge and strengths all learners bring from their communities
and identities. This perspective is known as Just Equitable and
Inclusive Education (JEIE) and is evident in all our programs.
College of Education students use this perspective to make
community-based assets an integral component of curricular and
pedagogical development to enhance academic success. In this way,
our students learn to value and draw upon students' backgrounds not
only to support them in developing skills leading to success in the
broader society, but also as a mechanism to transform our schools
and communities. We believe that all faculty and staff who work for
the College must share these same commitments. Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php
to learn more about Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE).

The inclusive excellence statement should focus on your commitment
to a Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education. The statement will be
assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and expertise
as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have an
emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.).

This statement can take several different forms and should address
at least one of the following:
your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE;
how you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities;
how you have personally experienced JEIE; and/or
your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

*EQUIVALENCY

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to
select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:

Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in Ethnic
Studies”.

Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in the example do

section, this candidate MUST complete the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) in order to be

qualifications. Do not assume that you do not need to submit a
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency because your degree is
similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

seeking to grow and diversify its programs through investments in
faculty with expertise in data science and artificial intelligence
as it applies to the research and scholarship in the Precision One
Health Initiative cluster. 
The College invites applications for multiple open rank, 9-month
tenured or tenure-track faculty positions at the Assistant,
Associate, or Full Professor level. These positions will start
on August 1, 2022, and are an academic year appointment (9 months)
with an opportunity to supplement salary during the summer.
The hiring is part of a campus-wide Presidential
Interdisciplinary Faculty Hiring Initiative in Data Science and
Artificial Intelligence that aims to recruit 50 faculty members who
will educate students and advance research in data science and AI.
Rather than being housed exclusively in a single department,
however, the majority of UGA’s newly recruited faculty will focus
on the fusion of data science and AI in cross-cutting areas such as
infectious diseases, integrative precision agriculture, ethics,
cybersecurity, resilient communities, and the environment.
The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this
initiative to demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our
faculty and ensure that we maintain and grow the culture of equity
and inclusivity in our college. Diversity, equity, and inclusion
are core values of the university and college, and this hiring
initiative will make use of the best practices to ensure an
inclusive search process. The Diversity
and Inclusion Plan for the college identifies priority
areas for our investments and through the 2021-2022 academic year
we will develop a Diversity Strategic Plan as part of a campus-wide
effort. The college offers structured mentoring programs for all
faculty that support professional development. Several programs
exist to enhance the inclusiveness of our college, including a
student-led Engineering
Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes
discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
The focus of this hiring initiative will be in the field of
Precision One Health, and will be part of a cluster spanning the
College of Engineering, College of Veterinary Medicine, College of
Public Health, and College of Pharmacy. Areas of research and
scholarship may include, but are not limited to, using data science
approaches to advance understanding of human health, diagnostics,
medical devices, and therapeutics.
The College of Engineering already has significant expertise in
basic and translational research in biochemical engineering,
cellular and pharmaceutical biomanufacturing, biomaterials and
tissue engineering, and biomedical optics. We are interested in
candidates that will strengthen or complement these areas in
keeping with the theme of data science and artificial intelligence
for precision health. 
Applications are sought in areas that interface data science and
artificial intelligence with Precision One Health, in particular
the use of mathematical modeling and systems biology tools to
develop quantitative models of complex physiological systems to
understand mechanisms of disease progression and/or
pharmacodynamics. 
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a rapidly
growing engineering college that combines interdisciplinary
research and scholarship with excellent instruction and service.
The UGA College of Engineering currently enrolls over
2,500 engineering majors and has over 80 full-time faculty across
fifteen-degree programs.  Significant investments in
infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of laboratory
facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms and
instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have space
in two major capital projects on campus to create interdisciplinary
research facilities. Our main instructional facility has also
undergone complete renovation to create flexible classrooms that
enable a range of teaching modalities and the incorporation of
interdisciplinary instructional labs. The common instructional
facilities also foster diversity since they allow faculty, staff,
and students to interact and collaborate in a single facility.

at Arizona State University is conducting a national search for a
unique open rank tenured or tenure-track position
focused on media and Indigenous communities. The role is part of a
larger programmatic strategy to elevate Indigenous issues and the
role of the media in those communities. The student-powered,
faculty-led Cronkite News, the news division of Arizona PBS,
publishes content about Indigenous communities in a dedicated
vertical, and the school hosts the headquarters of Indian Country
Today. 
The Southwest Borderlands Initiative Professor of Media and
Indigenous Communities will expand the school’s commitment in this
area, and serve as a national thought leader in understanding and
addressing a host of disparities resulting from and perpetuated by
news coverage, strategic communication, and popular culture.
The primary focus of the role will be to conduct systematic
social scientific and/or humanistic research to understand the
complex intersections and relations between media and the social,
political, economic, and cultural dimensions of Indigenous
populations. The person selected will be expected to publish in
scholarly journals and attend and present at relevant academic
conferences, as well as deliver public talks about their work.
The SWBI Professor will work with ASU students, faculty, tribal
partners and industry groups to more effectively communicate
perspectives of Indigenous Americans, teach and inspire a new
generation of communicators and scholars, and shape new narratives
for Indigenous communities.
Applicants must have a relevant Ph.D. or related terminal degree
at the time of appointment. Candidates should demonstrate a strong
interdisciplinary research agenda in relation to Indigenous
communities and populations, broadly understood, and be prepared to

additional SWBI professors serve in academic units across ASU.
 
Institutional Support
The SWBI Professor will join a team of Cronkite faculty and
students who are committed to serving American Indian communities.

Arizona PBS, produces daily, multiplatform coverage of issues
affecting American Indians in the Southwest. This content is
distributed through Cronkite News broadcast and digital platforms,
tribal media and national partners including Indian Country Today
and the PBS NewsHour. The school is also home to
the headquarters of Indian Country Today, a
multiplatform nonprofit news organization dedicated to Indigenous
communities across the country.
Harvard University’s 
Nieman Reports identified Cronkite News as one of the few
organizations providing strong reporting on Indian Country. In
August, the 
Native American Journalists Association awarded Cronkite
students thirteen National Native Media Awards—ten of which were
first place awards—across broadcast, writing and online news
categories.
ASU is a nationally recognized leader in Indigenous Studies and
transdisciplinary work with American Indian communities. The new
SWBI Professor will work with colleagues in existing programs,
including the Office of American Indian Initiatives, American
Indian Studies, the American Indian Policy Institute, the Center

larger efforts.

SAINT MARTIN’S UNIVERSITY
 
Established in 1895, Saint Martin’s University is the
educational mission of Saint Martin’s Abbey, a Catholic Benedictine
monastery, whose members pray, work, and live together on the
University campus. The physical beauty of Saint Martin’s 300-acre
campus reflects the rich intellectual and spiritual nature of its
presence in the Pacific Northwest.
 
Essential features of University life are animated by its
Benedictine identity and its participation in the centuries-old
traditions of Catholic intellectual thought and the search for
truth.
 
Thus, the University honors students and guides them towards
achieving academic excellence. Superior teaching is the expected
norm. Rooted in the long tradition of the liberal arts, the
University curriculum cultivates creativity and the ability to
communicate and pursue ideas; critical thinking and independent
inquiry; academic proficiency; the formation of sound ethical
judgments; and service to humanity.
 
Reflecting the Benedictine virtue of hospitality, the University
welcomes and, indeed, seeks students and employees not only from
the Pacific Northwest, but also from other parts of the nation and
the world at its main and extension campuses. Saint Martin’s
treasures persons of all ages, religions, and nationalities as it
encourages cognizance of diverse viewpoints and an appreciation of
all cultures.
 
Ranked by Niche as the second (#2) most diverse private college
in Washington State in 2020. Saint Martin’s is extremely proud
of our student diversity.  Our university treasures persons of
all abilities, ages, ethnicities, genders, nationalities,
orientations, races, and religions.  In particular, we know
that students educated in an ethnically diverse setting perform
better academically and reap greater professional success than
their peers from more homogeneous learning environments. We proudly
celebrate that our student population is 51% undergraduate and 32%
graduate students of color.  We are committed to pursuing an
employee community that reflects a similar, if not the same
percentage.  
 
Therefore, we
intentionally encourage and request that
members of historically underrepresented groups apply to join this
community.  All of us, from all backgrounds, are making a
commitment to do and be better for our students, faculty, and
staff.
 
The Hal and Inge Marcus School of Engineering at Saint Martin's
University offers ABET accredited undergraduate programs in
mechanical and civil engineering, and graduate programs in civil
engineering, mechanical engineering and engineering management. The
School moved into Cebula Hall 2013, at the time the highest rated
LEED certified building in the Western Hemisphere, and completed a
new lab building 2016. A recent major Engineering Initiative has
led to new facilities, a larger faculty, and exciting opportunities

Department Summary
The Robert D. Clark Honors College (CHC) is a liberal arts honors
college within the University of Oregon. Founded in 1960, it is one
of the oldest public university honors colleges in the United
States. The College features a newly restructured curriculum that
provides students a strong interdisciplinary foundation in the
liberal arts, as well as a series of signature programs, including
Calderwood Seminars in Public Writing, the Inside-Out Prison
Exchange Program, and an Academic Residential Community. CHC
courses are typically run as seminars. They are writing-intensive
and open only to honors college students. Courses are capped at 19
students, allowing for vibrant intellectual discussions, unique
opportunities for pedagogical experimentation and extensive
faculty-student interaction.

The University of Oregon is home to a vibrant community of scholars
working in Latinx studies in different disciplines. The successful
candidate will have many opportunities for collaboration and
community across campus including the Center for Latino/a and Latin
American Studies (CLLAS), the Heritage Language Program, the
Department of Indigenous, Race and Ethnic Studies (IRES), and the
Latinx Academic Residential Community. In conjunction with the
Provost's Diversity Initiative, the university has launched
exciting new academic programs in Latinx Studies and Black
Studies.

The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the
traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Following
treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people were dispossessed
of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and
forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon. Today,
Kalapuya descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated
Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz

UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Beavers. While the city of Bemidji
— named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung (nicknamed Bemidji) —
is home to a diverse population of more than 15,000 people, it
serves a regional population of more than 100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

Department of Psychology

The College of Natural and Behavioral Sciences is one of six main
instructional academic units of the university. The Psychology
Department, an academic unit within the college, offers its
students the option to pursue a wide variety of areas in the study
of human and animal behavior while simultaneously providing a solid
foundation in research and scientific aspects of the field of
psychology. For students with a general interest in psychology,
many of our courses are fundamental in understanding oneself and
relating to others more effectively. At the undergraduate level,
the Department of Psychology provides opportunity for the study of
different aspects of the field. For students interested in the
research and scientific aspects, courses on the application of the
scientific method to the study of human and animal behavior are
offered. For those with applied interests, courses relating to
counseling, clinical, and health psychology as well as behavioral
medicine, industrial and organizational psychology, computers, and
service in community agencies are offered.

For more information: https://www.csudh.edu/psychology/

The Position

The candidate's area of specialization will be Biological
Psychology. Responsibilities will include teaching a subset of the
following courses: Biological Psychology, Psychopharmacology,
Sensation & Perception, Advanced Research Methods in Biological
Psychology, Research Seminar in Biological Psychology, and/or a
graduate seminar in Psychopharmacology. The candidate would develop
new courses in biological psychology to help meet that demand in
our program and may also need to teach other courses in the
undergraduate or graduate programs. Other duties include committee
work and maintaining an ongoing research program involving
students. In addition, the candidate will be responsible for
supervising and chairing graduate student theses in the Clinical
Psychology and/or Health Psychology MA programs. The candidate is
expected to establish and maintain an active research laboratory;

need of a vivarium. Additionally, candidates would have access to
shared core research facilities.

Responsibilities

The primary responsibilities of faculty members are to teach (four
courses per semester with opportunities for release), maintain an
active research program, advise students, mentor graduate student

Biology

The Biology Program at CSU Dominguez Hills is designed to provide

Our students have excelled as they pursue diverse career tracks.
Our pre-health students have been admitted to top graduate programs
in medicine, dentistry, and veterinary science. Students interested

scholarships supporting their undergraduate & graduate
education and teaching credential.

Many faculty in the biology department are using evidence-based
teaching practices including active learning, flipped classrooms,
and team-based approaches. CSUDH has multiple specially-designed

420399,James W. Wagner Chair in Ethics,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/420399/james-w-wagner-chair-in-ethics/,False,Emory University,"Georgia, United States",Salary Commensurate with experience,,"Emory University invites applications for the inaugural James W.
Wagner Chair in Ethics. This is an endowed chair faculty position
with a special emphasis on the ethics of artificial intelligence or
AI, created with the support of the university's board of trustees
to honor and recognize Emory President James W. Wagner (2003-2016)
for his ""commitment to education and life at Emory.""

Emory desires a leading scholar who works in AI ethics, governance,
responsible AI, or other fields concerned with the implications of
artificial intelligence in public and private settings. As
organizations increasingly rely on AI and as novel applications
emerge, ethically committed institutions like Emory will have the
responsibility of articulating values that can help guide
development and respond to emerging challenges. The Wagner Chair
should thus be comfortable with public scholarship and be able to
engage AI theorists and developers in concrete ways.

At Emory, the field of ethics is conceived comprehensively to
encompass humanistic, natural scientific, and social scientific
inquiry, as well the professions. Thus, we are searching for a
scholar with a history of productive, multi-disciplinary research
and teaching and an ability to work across units and schools.

Emory as well as Atlanta is already home to a broad range of AI
work. The University also features a large and well-integrated
Center for Ethics that brings together ethics scholars from around
campus, including some already working in AI ethics. The Wagner
Chair therefore will enter an existing community with the task of
deepening its ties and helping it grow--and growth is on the
horizon. Over the next several years, Emory is committed to
recruiting and hiring 40-60 AI researchers across the university.
The Wagner Chair is the initial step in a major initiative that
seeks to put Emory at the heart of the AI revolution.

Applicants should have an earned Ph.D. (or equivalent terminal
degree) in a relevant field with an academic record and trajectory
that is consistent with tenure and a named chair faculty
position.

How to Apply

Emory University is conducting a confidential search with the
support of Greenwood/Asher Associates. For more information about
the process and to submit nominations and/or application materials,
please contact:

Ms. Jeanie Andrews: jeanieandrews@greenwoodsearch.com
Ms. Lauren McCaghren: laurenmccaghren@greenwoodsearch.com
Applications should include:
o CV
o Letter of interest
o Links to top three representative publications
o Targeted statement (up to 1000 words) on the role of the ethics
of AI in a university setting and the major challenges and
opportunities for the field. Statements should be prepared for a
preliminary blind review by the search advisory committee and thus
should avoid immediately identifiable references.
o Potential (semi)finalists may be contacted for references and
evidence of strong teaching

For full consideration, applicant materials should ideally be
received by the priority deadline of January 31, 2022.

The DepartmentThe Women and Gender Studies
and Queer Studies Department at CSUF houses a collective of
teacher-scholars that explore the ways in which culturally
constructed understandings of gender, sexuality, and bodies work
together to shape and impact our identities, institutions,
relations, and experiences. We pay particular attention to the
intersectional modes through which these identity categories, and
related effects of power, are experienced, including the influences
of racialization, race, and white supremacy, class, religion,
citizenship, ableism, heternormativity, as well as other social
forces. Our courses and curriculum are designed to move students
from exploring key ideas, through a variety of theoretical frames
and methods, to the application of these ideas by way of active
engagement with contemporary social issues. This can take many
forms, including but not limited to campus and community organizing
and activism; coordinating events such as the Feminist Symposium;
writing, research and publishing workshops and opportunities; and
occasions to work collaboratively with faculty and other students
on a variety of related projects.

As a department, we are committed to the well-being of our
departmental members and community and as such have collectively
articulated a set of values, practices, and principles that guide
our communication, structure, conduct, and decision-making with
each other. We seek to practice and uplift these values in all that
we do, including through our contributions to student-centered
teaching, social justice oriented scholarly and creative activity,
and transformative consciousness-raising service.

This statement provides the candidate's unique perspective on

Diversity is a defining feature of California's past, present,
and future. Increasing the diversity of our educators to better
reflect the population of California is just one aspect of the
College of Education's dedication to just, equitable and inclusive
education. Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences,
values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and
circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender,
age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and
more.
All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an
integral component of curricular and pedagogical development to
enhance academic success. In this way, our students learn to value
and draw upon students' backgrounds not only to support them in
developing skills leading to success in the broader society, but
also as a mechanism to transform our schools and communities. We
believe that all faculty and staff who work for the College must
share these same commitments.
The diversity statement should focus on your commitment to a
Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education. The diversity statement
will be assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and
expertise as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have
an emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.)
This statement can take several different forms and should
address at least one of the following:
Your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE.
How you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities.
How you have personally experienced JEIE.
Your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

candidate statement on commitment to diversity
Diversity is a defining feature of California's past, present,
and future. Increasing the diversity of our educators to better
reflect the population of California is just one aspect of the
College of Education's dedication to just, equitable and inclusive
education. Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences,
values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and
circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender,
age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and
more.
All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an
integral component of curricular and pedagogical development to
enhance academic success. In this way, our students learn to value
and draw upon students' backgrounds not only to support them in
developing skills leading to success in the broader society, but
also as a mechanism to transform our schools and communities. We
believe that all faculty and staff who work for the College must
share these same commitments. Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php
to learn more about Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE).
The diversity statement should focus on your commitment to a
Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education. The diversity statement
will be assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and
expertise as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have
an emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.)
This statement can take several different forms and should
address at least one of the following:
Your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE.
How you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities.
How you have personally experienced JEIE.
Your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

Finalists will be required to have three
letters of recommendation submitted. Please have these ready for
the referents to submit. On the References page of the online
application, enter information and email addresses for three
referents who will provide a confidential letter of reference for
your application. At the appropriate time in the search process,
they will receive a request via email along with information on
uploading the letter. You will be able to verify that each letter
has been received by CSUF by logging back into your applicant
portal.

Please direct all questions about the position to: Carol Lundberg
at clundberg@fullerton.edu or
call 657‐278‐4022.

Application DeadlineTo be assured full
consideration, all application materials must be received by
November 15, 2021. The anticipated appointment
date is August 2022.

The CollegeThe College of Education is
committed to just, equitable, and inclusive education, with goals
to:
Reach the intersecting social identities of all learners
through the critical examination of implicit and explicit biases
and privileges in order to provide fair, respectful,
non-discriminatory, equitable, inclusive, and humanizing learning
environments.
Teach through an anti-racist lens using culturally and
linguistically relevant strategies, including educational
technologies and community engagement, to provide equitable
opportunities and supports necessary for all learners to attain
high-quality outcomes
Impact schools and communities through a commitment to
dismantling systems of oppression by supporting students, teachers,
and leaders as citizens in a highly diverse, global,
interconnected, and digital world.

In Spring 2021, the College of Education faculty from racially and
ethnically minoritized groups comprised 38% of faculty (all ranks,
including lecturers). In the Department of Educational Leadership,
students from racially and ethnically minoritized groups made up
84% of MSHE students and 56% of Community College Leadership Ed.D.
students. As part of our work to create a just, equitable and
inclusive educational system, the College of Education at CSUF
plans to hire four tenure-track faculty members with a demonstrated
record of success in research, teaching and/or service with Black
populations and anti-racist teaching.

The DepartmentThe Department of Educational
Leadership contains master's and doctoral programs in higher
education and P12 leadership, enrolling nearly 300 students in Fall
2021. This position would focus primarily on the higher education
programs, but candidates with P20 experience and expertise could
teach in P12 programs as well. The department uses a distributed
leadership model, with the expectation that all faculty share some
of the leadership responsibilities, though there are program
coordinators who carry the bulk of the program responsibilities.
The highly collaborative teams meet weekly in program meetings and
monthly in department meetings. The MSHE program is selective,
admitting approximately 30% of its applicants through a holistic
admissions process. MSHE students bring a wide diversity of life
experiences and strengths, often in areas that are undervalued in
traditional educational settings. The MSHE program partners with
the City of Maywood to host an annual education fair for families
and community members numbering over 1,000. The department includes
the Center for Research on Educational Access and Leadership
(CREAL), a center that produces educational assessments, research

SAINT MARTIN’S UNIVERSITY
 
Saint Martin’s University is an independent, four-year,
coeducational university located on a wooded campus of more than
300 acres in Lacey, Washington. Established in 1895 by the Catholic
Order of Saint Benedict. Saint Martin’s welcomes more than 1,300
undergraduate students and 250 graduate students from many ethnic
and religious backgrounds to its Lacey campus, and more students to
its extended campus located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
 
Established in 1895, Saint Martin’s University serves as the
educational mission of Saint Martin’s Abbey.  The Abbey is a
Catholic Benedictine monastery, whose members pray, work, and live
together on the University campus.  As the mission is Catholic
and Benedictine, one of our values is a spirit of hospitality
welcoming all, regardless of an individual’s faith, religion, or
spirituality. 
 
Essential features of University life are animated by its
Benedictine identity and its participation in the centuries-old
traditions of Catholic intellectual thought and the search for
truth.
 
Thus, the University honors students and guides them towards
achieving academic excellence. Superior teaching is the expected
norm. Rooted in the long tradition of the liberal arts, the
University curriculum cultivates creativity and the ability to
communicate and pursue ideas; critical thinking and independent
inquiry; academic proficiency; the formation of sound ethical
judgments; and service to humanity.
 
Reflecting the Benedictine virtue of hospitality, the University
welcomes and, indeed, seeks students and employees not only from
the Pacific Northwest, but also from other parts of the nation and
the world at its main and extension campuses. Saint Martin’s
treasures persons of all ages, religions, and nationalities as it
encourages cognizance of diverse viewpoints and an appreciation of
all cultures.
 
Money Magazine ranked Saint Martin’s University the No. 1 Best
Value for Small Private Colleges in Washington state for a second
straight year and placed No. 8 in Best Value for Small Colleges in
the West, a region which is comprised of Alaska, California,
Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Ranked by Niche as the
second (#2) most diverse private college in Washington State in
2020. Saint Martin’s is extremely proud of our student
diversity.  Our university treasures persons of all abilities,
ages, ethnicities, genders, nationalities, orientations, races, and
religions.  In particular, we know that students educated in
an ethnically diverse setting perform better academically and reap
greater professional success than their peers from more homogeneous
learning environments. We proudly celebrate that our student
population is 51% undergraduate and 32% graduate students of color.
 We are committed to pursuing an employee community that
reflects a similar, if not the same percentage.  
 
Therefore, we
intentionally encourage and request that
members of historically underrepresented groups apply to join this
community.  All of us, from all backgrounds, are making a
commitment to do and be better for our students, faculty, and
staff.
 
The Hal and Inge Marcus School of Engineering at Saint Martin's
University offers ABET-accredited undergraduate programs in
mechanical and civil engineering, computer science, and information
technology and graduate programs in civil engineering, mechanical
engineering, environmental engineering, engineering management and
computer science. The School moved into Cebula Hall in 2013, at the
time the highest-rated LEED certified building in the Western
Hemisphere, and completed a new lab building in 2016, where the
majority of our computer science program courses are taught. A
recent major Engineering Initiative has led to new facilities, a
larger faculty, and exciting opportunities for enhancing
programs.

UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the
city of Bemidji — named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung
(nicknamed Bemidji) — is home to a diverse population of more than
15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than
100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

About Lord Fairfax Community College
Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC) is a comprehensive,

with four locations – the Fauquier and Middletown campuses, the
Luray-Page County Center and the Vint Hill Site – as well as
outreach sites throughout the college’s service region. The service
region includes the counties of Clarke, Fauquier, Frederick, Page,
Rappahannock, Shenandoah, and Warren, and the city of
Winchester.
 
LFCC’s Middletown Campus and the Luray-Page County Center are

variety of outdoor recreational activities, historical sites, and a

Washington, D.C., this area offers the opportunity for living in a
beautiful rural landscape with easy access to our nation’s
capital.
 
LFCC offers nearly 75 associate degree and certificate programs
in a wide variety of disciplines, as well as workforce training
programs for employees and employers. LFCC offers a variety of day,

Fiscal year 2021 is one of the strongest years for the VCCS in
recent state budget history. The G3 (Get Skilled, Get a Job, Get

and computer science, manufacturing and skilled trades, public
safety and early childhood education. Participants will be required

work experience for each credit hour in which they are enrolled.
Lawmakers allocated $5 million in the upcoming budget year to hire
60 additional much-needed community college advisors to help new
students enroll and successfully navigate the world of higher
education. Additionally, the legislature approved money to give
state classified workers and college faculty (full-time and
adjunct) 5-percent pay raises, effective July 1, 2021. VCCS

employees also receive pay raises.

Assistant Professor of Extension in Plant Pathology

The University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (UC ANR), a statewide organization with local delivery,
in collaboration with the College of Natural and Agricultural
Sciences (CNAS), UC Riverside, invites applicants for a full-time
Assistant Professor of Extension in the area of Plant Pathology for
Subtropical Crops.

The position is 80% Extension and 20% Research with an academic
career-track, 11-month appointment in the Department of
Microbiology and Plant Pathology at UC Riverside (https://microplantpath.ucr.edu/).
The position will be available after January 2022. Salary is
competitive and commensurate with qualifications and
experience.

Required qualification for this position at the time of application
is a Ph.D. in Plant Pathology or a closely related
discipline.

Preferred qualifications for this position at the time of
application include: postdoctoral experience, documented experience
with subtropical crops, applied management of plant diseases, and
detection of plant pathogens or crop production.

Additional qualifications for this position, required at the time
of employment, include:
•	Demonstrated expertise or appropriate training in plant pathology
and plant protection.
•	Demonstrated ability or potential to develop an extension and
outreach program with local and regional application, statewide
impact and national recognition.
•	Demonstrated ability or potential to develop an applied research
program in one or more aspects of sustainable disease management of
subtropical crops.
•	Documented evidence of applied research activity and a record of
scientific publication productivity.
•	A record of acquisition of extramural funding or the potential to
do so.
•	Excellent interpersonal and communication skills and a
demonstrated ability to work with others in a collegial team
atmosphere.
•	Evidence of or potential for leadership and initiative.
•	Evidence of or potential for extending applied research and
conducting outreach education for growers, nurseries, government
agencies, and other stakeholders.

Subtropical crops are critical industries to Central and Southern
California, and California comprises a significant percentage of
production and consumption of these crops in the U.S. These
commodities are currently at a crossroads. The very existence of
the iconic California citrus is threatened by the Huanglongbing
disease, and avocado is at risk from the invasive pathogen
Raffaelea lauricola, the causal agent of laurel wilt. In addition,
Pierce's disease continues to threaten wine and table grape
production and the invasive Fusarium dieback-shot hole borer
disease-pest complex is rapidly destroying trees in urban and
native ecosystems in Southern California. Growers also experience
losses from a range of endemic fruit, foliar, branch, and root
pathogens and the problems are exacerbated by abiotic stresses
related to climate change such as extreme heat, drought, and water
quality and salinity.

The successful candidate will develop an innovative educational
extension program with local and regional application, statewide
impact, and national recognition. The incumbent will collaborate
closely with colleagues in CNAS, across UC, and within the UC ANR
Cooperative Extension network who specialize on subtropical crops,
IPM, and plant protection for the dissemination of science-based
information and provide field and laboratory diagnostic services.
The incumbent will also develop productive working relationships
with commodity groups, agro-biochemical industry personnel, state
and federal agricultural and regulatory agencies, and
non-government organizations to advance their program.

The successful candidate will develop a creative, extramurally
funded, productive applied research program. Collaboration with
relevant personnel, including county-based UC ANR Advisors,
Agricultural Experiment Station faculty at UC campuses, and
USDA-ARS scientists is expected. Research will be focused on
relevant sustainable and integrated disease management strategies
for subtropical crops, such as citrus, avocado, and grapes, and
related diseases that will complement the extension program and
lead to scholarly contributions. Areas of research could include
the etiology and epidemiology of endemic and invasive diseases,
improved methods of pathogen detection, understanding the influence
of microbial communities and climate change on disease outbreaks,
and development of new and improved disease management
practices.

Responsibilities
Extension and Outreach: Provide leadership for statewide extension
activities on diseases and pathogens of subtropical crops through:
1) development of educational programs on how to diagnose diseases
and apply appropriate disease management strategies through
extension of science-based information through the network of UC
ANR Advisors and Cooperative Extension personnel; 2) conducting
workshops, speaking at appropriate events, and providing diagnostic
and pathogen detection services; 3) interacting in a two-way manner
with growers, nurseries, pest control advisors, chemical and
biological plant protection industry personnel, shippers, commodity
organizations, allied professionals and agricultural organizations,
environmental and other state and federal agencies, and
non-government organizations, and academic clientele such as UC ANR
Advisors, AES faculty, and Master Gardeners, to identify and be
responsive to their needs; 4) acting as a liaison between industry
organizations, the public, the University of California, and state
and federal agencies; 5) participating in graduate academic
programs (MS, PhD) of the campus and participate in classes

other courses offered through the Department; and 6) development of
web-based resources, training courses, and publications of lay and
peer-reviewed literature.

Research: The successful candidate will develop a creative and
productive applied research program on relevant sustainable and
integrated disease management strategies for subtropical crops such
as citrus, avocado, and grapes and related diseases affecting urban
or natural ecosystems that will complement the extension program
and lead to scholarly contributions. The incumbent will provide
leadership in directing research projects of professional
researchers and graduate students, or postdoctoral scholars, and
publish results in peer-reviewed professional and scientific
journals and appropriate UCCE outlets. Areas of emphasis will be
based on the needs identified and feedback received from the
extension and outreach program, and could include: etiology and
epidemiology of endemic and emerging diseases, improved methods of
pathogen detection, understanding the influence of microbial
communities and climate change on pathogens and disease outbreaks,
mitigation of the spread of invasive pathogens, and developing new
or improved disease management practices. Research areas could also
include the use of new epidemiological tools, improved training
modalities for growers and first responders that optimize pathogen
and disease comprehension. Additional research areas could include
the use of information technologies, big data, and forecasting for
the improvement of best practices for disease outbreaks prevention
and minimization of losses impacting subtropical crops of economic
importance in California. Collaborations within the UC ANR network
(e.g., Advisors, Specialists, AES faculty), state (CDFA) and
federal partners (USDA-ARS and USDA-APHIS) and funding from
extramural sources, is a fundamental and indispensable requirement
of the position.

Service: University and public service through committee work at
the department, college, campus, or system wide level and
participation in professional organizations, continuing education
and other appropriate means is required. Providing field and
laboratory diagnostic services is expected.

incumbent will act in an advisory capacity to pest control
advisors, farm advisors and other specialists in plant pathology
matters and for technical advice on disease prevention and
management.
