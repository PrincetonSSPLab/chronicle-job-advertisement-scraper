About the University
Texas A&M University-Central Texas (A&M-Central Texas)
was established in 2009 as an upper-level undergraduate and
graduate institution within the Texas A&M University
System.  In 2010, the U.S. Army donated 600+ acres of land for
our campus. Our third major building opened this spring.
A&M-Central Texas is accredited by the Southern Association
of Colleges & Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) and COBA
is currently ACSBP accredited. COBA is also presently pursuing
AACSB accreditation and the initial Self Evaluation Report (iSER)
was accepted in April of 2019.
A&M-Central Texas is located on the southern edge of
Killeen, TX, a city of about 120,000 (not including the 50,000+ on
Fort Hood, which is the largest Army installation in the world).
 Killeen is about an hour north of Austin, and just a few
miles west of the I-35 corridor, which is one of the fastest
trans-metropolitan regions in North America. The area is known for
a low cost of living, friendly people, and the ability to choose
one’s living lifestyle due to the diversity of the area and ease of
travel (mile a minute on average).
The student body is one of the most diverse in the state and
COBA students generally classify as non-traditional, with an
average age of about 33 years. However, that has been trending
downward recently.  A significant portion of the student
population is military affiliated (active duty, spouse, veteran and
other dependents).  Because of the strong ties to serving
military personnel around the world, many courses are offered
online, in addition to the traditional day and evening face to face
courses.
Faculty members would first and foremost be expected to provide
excellent instruction and support other aspects of the college and
university mission as appropriate.  Teaching at a young,
growing institution can be a lot of work, but it's also a unique
opportunity to be able to put your fingerprint on an institution
that is changing lives daily, and hopefully for many years to
come.

collaborations are key to a long-lasting creative career.

Our facilities are spread across three buildings on campus; the
Fielding L. Wright Art Gallery which houses a dedicated exhibit
space of over 2000 square feet along with the University’s
permanent art collection. It also is the home of one digital lab as
well as a fibers studio. Next door is the Holcombe-Norwood Hall,
home to a dedicated ceramics facility, a sculpture and wood working
space with the largest educational foundry in Mississippi, a 3500+

Endowed Professorship, Urban
Tech
Jacobs Technion-Cornell
Institute
at Cornell Tech
New York City, New
York
 
In support of a major initiative at Cornell Tech in New York
City, the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute seeks to fill a tenured
faculty position at the full professor level in the emerging area
of urban technology. The position-holder will be nominated for
an endowed chair.
 
Cornell Tech is a unique engineering and applied science campus
that develops leaders and technologies for the digital age, through
research, technology commercialization, and graduate-level
education at the professional master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral
levels. The Jacobs Institute is a major component of Cornell Tech
whose mission is to push the envelope of academia and to transform
industries where technology’s impact is most positively felt.
Jacobs faculty members combine world-class research and teaching
with transdisciplinary thinking.
Our innovative new thrust in urban tech is embodied in a
growing, multifaceted Urban Tech Hub, which includes a master’s
degree program, research initiatives, external partnerships,
events, startups, and thought leadership on critical issues facing
the cities of today and tomorrow. The Hub will emphasize
applications through which technology can make cities stronger,
healthier, fairer, and more resilient. These are likely to include,
among others, urban mobility, intelligence in urban infrastructure
and the built environment, energy and other resource distribution,
public health in cities, sustainability, and technology-supported
governance and community participation. Cornell Tech’s core
technical disciplines of computer science, information science,
electrical and computer engineering, and operations research and
information engineering will provide the foundation for world-class
research and impact in these application domains.
 
For this position, we seek candidates with demonstrated
cross-disciplinary success in translating research results into
real-world impact in both a core technical area and one or more
domains related to urban systems. Our ideal candidate will come
from computer science, information science, electrical and computer
engineering, or operations research and information engineering,
with a proven track record of bridging to more specifically urban
systems-related disciplines such as urban planning, architecture,
civil engineering, and urban policy; or from an urban-related
field, bringing a strong digital foundation (i.e., in computer
science, operations research, etc.) with a record of reflecting
that foundation in one of the application areas of concern.
Our new faculty member will work closely with the leader of the
non-academic part of our Urban Tech Hub to develop a world-leading
presence in an area of vital importance to cities around the world,
and will serve as academic leadership for hub-related activities,
our innovative Master of Science program, and significant research
initiatives. The new faculty member’s departmental affiliation will
depend on their disciplinary background.
Candidates must hold a Ph.D., have demonstrated an ability to
conduct outstanding research at the level of a tenured full
professor at Cornell University, and also have a strong commitment
to engagement outside of academia in ways that foster significant
commercial or societal impact, as aligned with the mission of the
Cornell Tech campus. Successful candidates are expected to pursue
an active research program, to teach master’s and Ph.D.-level
graduate courses, and to supervise graduate students.
Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae and brief statements
of research and teaching interests and contributions to diversity,
identify two top publications to which they have made significant
contributions, and request that at least four references on their
behalf be submitted through https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/17406.
A distinguishing characteristic of research at Cornell Tech, in
addition to world-class academic work, is that it engages deeply
with external communities, organizations, K-12 education, and
industry to address real-world problems and contexts that amplify
the direct commercial and societal impact of our research.
Accordingly, within a clearly identified “external engagement”
section of the research statement, the candidate should address
prior accomplishments and future plans related to this kind of
direct commercial and/or societal impact of their research.
Cornell Tech particularly values diversity and
inclusion. Applicants are asked to submit a Statement of
Contribution to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to describe their
potential contributions in this area. See http://facultydevelopment.cornell.edu/information-for-faculty-candidates/ for
the university’s commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity,
including suggestions for what we are looking for in such
statements.
Please submit the following items online at this website to
complete your application:

Cover letter
Curriculum vitae
Research statement, including a section addressing industry
engagement or commercial and/or societal impact of research
Teaching statement
Statement of Contribution to Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion
PDF of 1st of 2 most significant papers
PDF of 2nd of 2 most significant papers
Four or more reference letters (to be submitted by the
reference writers at this site)

To ensure full consideration, applications should be received by
February 1, 2021, but will be considered until the position is
filled.
Questions may be directed to hr@tech.cornell.edu.

network of major highways that make EKU easily accessible from all
parts of Kentucky and surrounding states. Richmond is 26 miles
southeast of Lexington, Kentucky. Interstate Highways I-75
(north-south) and I-64 (east-west) make the metropolitan areas of
Cincinnati, 112 miles to the north, and Louisville, 110 miles to
the west, within convenient distance by automobile. Richmond is
also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and
Kentucky Route 52 from the east and west. The Bluegrass, Mountain,
Daniel Boone, and Cumberland Parkways provide even greater
accessibility by automobile since the city is located near the
convergence of these arterial highways into the interstate
system.

EKU is a dedicated high-quality instruction, scholarship, and
service, and places emphasis on the three in that order. Through
its colleges and schools, the University seeks to offer quality
instruction at a variety of degree levels in general education, the
arts, the sciences, business, education, pre-professional and
professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through
consultative services, continuing education, and the extended
campus, the University seeks to provide service to the community
and the region. Research seeks both to advance knowledge in the
subject matter areas with which the University is concerned and to
support the primary function of teaching.

equitable inclusion of students and colleagues of all backgrounds
in all aspects of college life.
have the ability to teach at all levels in the undergraduate
biology and environmental studies curricula, including integrative
courses.

Postdoctoral research, industry, non-profit or government
experience, and/or prior teaching experience are desirable
additional qualifications. We are particularly interested in

departments.
The departments are particularly interested in applicants who
can and will advance the college’s goals for diversity, equity and

majors. These core courses typically include Bio 261 (Ecological
Principles), Envst 137 (Intro to Environmental Studies), and
developing a course in your area of interest.

Faculty - Tenure Track in Architecture Program

Position Category: Faculty - Tenure Track (FT)

Summary:
Utah Valley University's Architecture and Engineering Design
Department (AED) invites applications for a full-time, 9-month,
tenure-track appointment in architecture at the rank of Assistant
Professor. The successful candidate is expected to begin employment
in August 2021. This position will fall under the direction of the
Dean of the College of Engineering and Technology, the AED
Department Chair, and the Architecture Degree Program Coordinator.
The new Bachelor of Architecture degree program at UVU is currently
seeking eligibility with the National Architecture Accreditation
Board (NAAB).

The AED Department is particularly interested in candidates with
expertise in classical architectural design. Appointees will
demonstrate a thorough knowledge and understanding of traditional
building materials, classical design theory, and vernacular
construction methods. The successful applicant will be responsible
for teaching undergraduate design studios, and will have expertise
in one or more of the following areas:


Passive and active environmental building systems
Building science and envelope design
Global history of architecture
Building codes and construction law
Construction documentation and specifications
Professional practice

The primary responsibility for a successful candidate will be to
assist in developing and teaching core course content in their
assigned subject areas. The opportunity to develop additional
courses in the candidate's area(s) of specialization will be
encouraged. Additional duties for full-time faculty may involve
student advising, recruiting events, curricular development,
maintaining accreditation standards, and service to the University,
Department, and profession. Preference will be given to candidates
with prior teaching experience and architectural licensure.

Program Description
Building on UVU's dual mission model, the architecture program
seeks to skillfully weave together current technologies with
time-tested classical design principles, vernacular and traditional
building methods, and multidisciplinary industry-based coursework.
The architecture program teaches students to focus on durability,
longevity, building maintenance, and the adaptive-reuse potential
of buildings as a truly sustainable practice. Students research
traditional principles and philosophies of history to encourage a
sense of community, a balanced respect for our natural environment,
and wise use of limited resources and energy. Program coursework
studies the past to inform the future. We emphasize enduring design
standards from history to influence how technologies are
incorporated into contemporary works. The degree features a
rigorous design-oriented curriculum with a solid foundation in
technology, practice-based coursework, plan and document
generation, building codes, specifications, digital parametric
modeling, building information modeling, architectural
visualization, digital fabrication, building envelope systems,
structural systems, and building sustainability.

The program is specifically designed for students who are
continuing from UVU's Engineering Design Technology (Architectural
Drafting Track) A.S. degree. Following the associate degree,
students connect current technologies, with the training in
classical architecture to conceive of comprehensive architectural
works to meet contemporary needs. We call this contemporary
architectural classicism.

UVU offers an excellent benefits package which includes a generous
leave policy, 12 paid holidays, affordable medical and dental
insurance options, life and AD&D insurance, tuition waiver
(undergraduate resident) for employee and dependents and
substantial employer contribution to a retirement plan.

*EQUIVALENCY

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to
select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position. Candidates
whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree exactly as
listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent qualifications
are encouraged to complete and submit the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency (Download PDF
reader) (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:
Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.
Candidate's transcripts state: “Master's degree in agricultural
science”.
Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in

qualifications section, this candidate MUST complete the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency (Download PDF
reader) in order to be considered (Download PDF reader). When completing
the form, be sure to explain in detail how your qualifications are
equivalent to the required minimum qualifications. Do not assume
that you do not need to submit a Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency because your degree is similar to a degree stated in
the minimum qualifications. Degree titles that are not an exact
match will not be considered outside of the equivalency
process.
The equivalency review is an independent
process for district wide disciplines that is separate from the
recruitment process to fill a vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline
experts that is coordinated by an Academic Senate President will
review the equivalency materials and make a recommendation as to
whether or not the applicant demonstrated they have qualifications
that are equivalent to those shown in the minimum qualifications
section of the job posting. For disciplines that are unique to a
specific campus the equivalency may be done by the hiring committee
along with an Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the
hiring committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process. 

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by
which equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD
Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD
Administrative Policy 7211.

modeling, disturbance and land cover shifts, and trophic
interactions. In addition, we expect that the applicant's research
program will include robust translational elements, e.g., ecosystem
services, ecological restoration, land management practices
(especially public land issues such as fire and grazing), or
actionable ecological forecasting.

mentor and advise graduate students and post-doctoral researchers
from diverse backgrounds, as well as teach graduate and
undergraduate courses within their area of expertise, depending on

Quinney College of Natural Resources and the Ecology Center.
Through collaborations with faculty and extension personnel, the
appointed faculty member is expected to become a key player in the
highly productive team of ecologists at Utah State University. We
are interested in applicants who can prosper within a
collaborative, interdisciplinary environment of physical, life, and
social scientists.

The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) is the independent,
private-sector organization with responsibility for the oversight,
administration, and finances of its standard-setting Boards, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and their Advisory Councils.
Through its standard-setting Boards, the organization establishes
and improves financial accounting and reporting standards—known as
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP—for public and
private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and state and
local governments in the United States. The FAF Board of Trustees
selects and appoints the members of the FASB and the GASB and
protects the independence and integrity of the standard-setting
process. The FAF is a non-stock Delaware corporation that operates
exclusively for charitable, educational, scientific, and literary
purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The FAF, FASB, and GASB are located in Norwalk,
Connecticut.

The FAF is seeking a highly qualified individual with substantial
recent experience as a tenured professor of accounting to fill one
of the seven seats on the GASB. The GASB is comprised of members
with experience as state and local government financial statement
auditors and preparers, a governmental financial statement user, a
public accounting auditor, and a governmental accounting academic.
The background and perspective of a tenured professor of accounting
are important to the success of the GASB.

Background and Experience

Substantial recent employment experience as a tenured professor
of accounting is required. Experience and a background in
governmental accounting are required.
A PhD or DBA from an accredited college or university is
required.
Holding a Certified Public Accountant designation or having
other professional certifications or advanced degrees in business
administration, public administration, or a related field is
desirable, but not mandatory.
Being an active participant in related professional
associations is desirable, but not mandatory.


Qualifications
The successful candidate will demonstrate:

Knowledge of state and local government financial
accounting and reporting. A candidate should have
knowledge of, and experience with, financial accounting and
reporting for the state and local government organizations included
under the GASB jurisdiction.
Commitment to operate as an advocate for the public
interest. A candidate should be free of conflicts of
interest (employment by a college or university is allowed) and
should be an advocate for the public interest with the goal of
producing the highest possible quality of standards that serve the
current needs of users.
High level of intellect applied with integrity and with
discipline. The Board deals with controversial, complex
issues. High intelligence helps in absorbing a variety of
complicated information and in understanding the pros and cons of
the arguments advanced. Intelligence must be used with discipline,
that is, with objectivity, logic, and concentrated energy.
Judicial temperament. Candidate demonstrates
the discipline of gathering all evidence, weighing arguments, and
making timely decisions free of bias or partiality.
Ability to work in a collegial atmosphere. The
GASB is a collegial body, characterized by group decision making.
Give-and-take is required among the decision makers in order to
arrive at timely, workable solutions to problems. A collegial
process can work effectively only if individual members are
tactful, respectful of one another’s views, and mindful of the need
to agree on workable, rather than ideal, solutions to
problems.
Communication skills. Board members should be
able to communicate effectively in both oral and written form. Oral
communication includes discussion in Board meetings, dialogue with
fellow Board members and the technical staff, speeches, and other
contacts with persons outside the GASB. Written communication
includes internal memoranda, speeches, articles, and correspondence
with constituents. All of these kinds of communication require
thought, tact and clarity of expression.
Awareness of the state and local government financial
reporting environment. The GASB deals with technical
accounting issues, but its decisions must be made in the context of
trends and events in the government and financial community as a
whole and in the context of the needs of users of governmental
financial reports. A member of the GASB should have a broad
understanding of the environment in which government operates and
the forces that impact that environment. Consideration will be
given to a candidate’s understanding of the relationship between
accounting and reporting standards and government operations,
finance, and public accountability.
Commitment to the GASB’s mission. A candidate
for membership on the GASB should be committed to the Board’s
mission as described in its mission statement and to the hard work
required to fulfill it. A candidate should understand the role of
due process, the need for consensus building in the promulgation of
standards, and a commitment to the goals of the GASB’s strategic
plan. The candidate should believe in the importance of the Board’s
work, be devoted to the overriding objectives of the GASB, and be
sensitive to the concerns of the GASB’s stakeholders.


Commitment for Part-Time Membership
The GASB meets in Norwalk, Connecticut, approximately nine times
each year, generally every six weeks. Meetings are usually held on
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (normally two and a half days,
ending at noon on Thursday). A teleconference meeting is normally
held in the middle of the six-week cycle (generally on a Monday or
a Tuesday for a half day in the afternoon). To accommodate
attendance at Governmental Accounting Standards Advisory Council
GASAC and task force meetings, the GASB may meet on a Monday and
conclude on Friday. Occasionally, GASAC and Task Force meetings may
be held at times other than a GASB meeting week. Availability
during meeting times is very important. A Board member is expected
to attend all Board meetings and, therefore, should schedule all
other activities so that those activities do not conflict with the
Board meeting schedule. Board meetings normally are scheduled one
year in advance. TENTATIVE 2022 Board meeting dates: January 25—27,
March 8—10, April 19—-21, May 31—June 2, July 12—4, August 24—26,
October 11—13, and November 16—18. Significant prior preparation is
required to effectively participate in the Board meetings. In
addition to the Board, GASAC, and task force meetings, there is
also a requirement to attend public hearings and certain meetings
of key stakeholder organizations.  These meetings might
average four to six days a year.  The overall time commitment
is considered equivalent to one third of a full-time
position.


Equal Opportunity/ADA Employer
Additional information about the GASB can be found at the GASB’s
website at www.gasb.org.

expenses and accommodations for the meetings are paid for by the

research and policy; defense, security and military STI; STI
policies and institutions; and public interest technology and the

someone whose scholarship, policy engagement and teaching inform
and integrate with one another, and are strongly complementary with
ASU’s commitment to “advancing research and discovery of public
value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic,
social, cultural and overall health of the communities it
serves.”
A successful candidate could be appointed as a tenured full

the diversity of students and communities we serve. ASU has a deep
commitment to use-inspired, public-serving work in both the local
and global contexts (see ASU’s design aspirations: https://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/about/design-aspirations).

APPOINTMENT DATE:  August 17, 2021
 
 
Bemidji State University (BSU) invites
applicants to join our team as an Assistant or Associate
Professor of Nursing. BSU’s vision is to educate people to
lead inspired lives. To accomplish BSU’s vision, the University
prioritizes creating a culture in which diversity is embraced and
all people are safe, welcome, and validated. BSU also prioritizes
increasing engagement with Indigenous communities to become a
destination university.
 
BSU is located amid the lakes and forests of northern Minnesota
and occupies a wooded campus along the shore of Lake Bemidji. 
BSU balances rigorous academia with the opportunity to enjoy a fun,
robust, outdoor culture.  The proximity to the lake and the
surrounding north woods allows easy access to an assortment of
recreation.  Major campus facilities are connected by
all-season underground passages for safe and warm travel during the
cold, winter months. 
 
Enrolling more than 5,000 students, BSU offers more than 70
undergraduate majors and eight graduate degrees encompassing arts,
sciences and select professional programs. BSU is a member of the
Minnesota State system of colleges and universities and has a
faculty and staff of more than 550. BSU’s Shared
Fundamental Values include civic engagement and
leadership, international and multicultural understanding, belief
in the power of the liberal arts, and environmental
stewardship.
 
BSU’s Nursing Program is an established and 
fully accredited nursing program with a 30-year history of
providing baccalaureate-educated nurses to the region. The
Program’s mission is to engage in scholarship that supports the

through their career planning processes, providing the support and
resources necessary for students to achieve their goals. 
 
BSU’s Nursing Program offers two tracks to complete the 
baccalaureate degree — a four-year track for students just
beginning their education and a two-year track for students who are
licensed Registered Nurses with an associate degree or
diploma.  The focus of the Program is to give students broad,
practical experiences along with the deep, technical education
required of a nurse. The Program applies a student-centered
approach that mentors students throughout their educational
journeys.  With its proximity to the region’s American Indian
population, BSU has a unique opportunity to develop nurses with
cultural awareness. The Program includes cultural-care

on-campus classroom, lab/simulation nursing classes in the

nursing, nursing leadership and management, maternal newborn, child
adolescent, family, adult, and geriatric
nursing. 
Contribute to a program of scholarship within the
discipline, student advising, service to the University and
community, and other associated faculty duties.
Provide interdisciplinary involvement in activities that

UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
 
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Beavers. While the city of Bemidji
— named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung (nicknamed Bemidji) —
is home to a diverse population of more than 15,000 people, it
serves a regional population of more than 100,000.
 
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
 
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
 
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
 
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

Tenure-Track Faculty Positions in Natural Hazards, Energy,
Minerals and Materials

Penn State's Alliance for Education, Science, Engineering and

populations in Africa and its diaspora through research, innovation
and solution-based collaboration. Its goal is addressing problems
through co-design, increasing capacity and providing access to
underserved and underrepresented students, professionals and
institutions. AESEDA currently has partnerships in Sub-Saharan
Africa. It looks to leverage those partnerships to expand faculty
research, teaching and outreach in two broad areas: Natural
Hazards, and Energy, Minerals and Materials. All academic
departments in EMS are participating, including Meteorology and
Atmospheric Science, Geosciences, Geography, Energy and Mineral
Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering. Joint

of observations and tools may provide a unique perspective for the
prediction of natural hazards, mitigate the impacts of natural
hazards on humans and infrastructure, and can inform
decision-makers.

minerals and materials. We seek a candidate whose area of research
focuses on one or more of the following areas: renewable energy,
carbon capture and storage, mineral processing and

impacts of energy technologies on the environment and ecosystems,
mineral/energy justice and policy.

The final candidates are expected to leverage AESEDA's partnerships
in West and Southern Africa as they develop their research
portfolio, while also serving as an anchor for the AESEDA community
at Penn State University. Successful applicants will be expected to
engage with our active research and teaching community by
developing a vigorous, externally funded research program,
contributing to the home department's undergraduate and graduate
teaching mission, and working to advance diversity, equity, and
inclusion by assisting in improving underrepresented minority
student populations at the departmental level and within the
College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.

Open Rank Faculty Position in Design

College/School/Unit: College of Fine Arts
Department: School of Design and Creative Technologies
Posted: Dec 14, 2020
Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The Department of Design in the School of Design and
Creative Technologies (SDCT) at The University of Texas at
Austin (UT) seeks two or more open-rank faculty in Design. Tenure
status and rank will be based on candidates' profiles and
experience.

One of our goals as a department is to ensure that design
serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races, ethnicities,
genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic statuses,
nationalities, and linguistic and cultural traditions. Recognizing
that the profession of design as it exists in the United States
today is both a product and a (re)producer of white supremacy,
patriarchy, ableism, and elitism, we invite applications from
academics and practitioners whose teaching, scholarship,
professional practice, creative activity, and/or service disrupts
this tradition. We especially welcome applications from candidates
belonging to groups that have been historically underrepresented in
higher education, including women, racial and ethnic minorities,
LGBTQIA people, and people with disabilities.

As a relatively small program needing to grow in the areas of
interaction, service, graphic, and industrial design, we are less
concerned right now with hiring in any one of these areas of
specialization than in being led by and collaborating with faculty
colleagues whose practice and teaching will help orient the
department toward social justice, inclusion, and equity.

Qualifications

Required Qualifications:
To be considered for this position, you must:

hold a terminal degree in your field by date of hire, OR
possess a record of equivalent professional experience or
scholarly/creative achievement;
have a record of working productively with people of diverse
disciplines, ranks, races, ethnicities, nationalities, gender
identities, sexual orientations, ages, and abilities;
demonstrate a high level of craft in one or more subfields of
design, including expertise with contemporary design processes,
workflows, and relevant software.


Desired Qualifications:
We are particularly interested in candidates who:

can teach UI/UX design, industrial design, graphic design, or
service/experience design;
engage in creative or scholarly work that centers on issues of
race, ethnicity, decoloniality, intersectionality, oppression,
resistance, and/or activism;
have a record of teaching, scholarship, professional practice,
creative activity, and/or service that centers on ensuring that
design serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse races,
ethnicities, genders, sexualities, abilities, ages, socioeconomic
statuses, nationalities, and linguistic and cultural
traditions;
have taught both small- and large-enrollment courses;
have taught hybrid and/or online courses.


Responsibilities of this position may
include:

teaching introductory courses in the Design BA, BFA, and MFA
programs and/or MA in Design in Health program (to both design
majors and curious non-majors from engineering, business, computer
science, medicine, and other fields);
developing and teaching introductory through advanced
undergraduate and graduate courses, including thematic/special
topics courses, in your area of specialization;
team-teaching interdisciplinary courses that enroll students
from multiple majors;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate independent
studies;
supervising undergraduate and/or graduate final projects,
exhibitions, and/or reports;
writing or revising undergraduate and graduate curricula;
serving on department, school, college, and/or university
committees.


Faculty appointed with tenure or to the tenure track are also
expected to maintain an active agenda of scholarly research,
professional practice, and/or creative work that creates or
sustains their national profile in the field. Non-tenure-track
faculty are encouraged—but not required—to maintain an active
professional practice or scholarly research program.

Application Instructions

To apply for the position, please submit the following to
Interfolio at https://apply.interfolio.com/82052:

A letter of application explaining your qualifications for, and
interest in, the position, including discussion of your most
significant research/creative/professional, teaching, and service
activities in the arena of design for equity, diversity, inclusion,
and/or social justice;
A curriculum vitae (CV) or professional resume;
A link to or pdf of a portfolio of recent design work
Contact information for three references (letters will be
requested only for finalists).


Applications received by January 22, 2021 will be assured a full
review. Applications received after that date will be reviewed as
needed until the position is filled. Due to current travel
restrictions, we expect to conduct all interviews remotely.

Questions about the application process and Interfolio may be
directed to SDCT Executive Assistant Mr. Cameron Weed at cweed@austin.utexas.edu;
questions about the positions themselves may be directed to search
committee chair Prof. Jason Wilkins at jasonwilkins@utexas.edu.

If you are excited about the possibilities of working in the
Department of Design, but don't fit this particular job
description, please see our open call for faculty at https://apply.interfolio.com/79104.

About the Department of Design
The design program at UT, formerly a division of the Department of
Art and Art History, became the Department of Design in 2017 and
combined forces with the recently created Department of Arts and
Entertainment Technologies, the Center for Integrated Design, and
the Design Institute for Health to form the new School of Design
and Creative Technologies (SDCT). The move to SDCT has enabled the
design program to expand its enrollment and course offerings to
meet growing demand from majors and non-majors and to develop
industry partnerships. The department now offers two undergraduate
degrees and two graduate degrees, as well as extensive additional
coursework geared toward students majoring elsewhere on campus who
wish to be more designerly in their approach to their work.

About The University of Texas at Austin
The University of Texas at Austin is a flagship, comprehensive
research university of over 50,000 students that is routinely
ranked in the top 50 universities globally by U.S. News and World
Report, Times Higher Education, and the Center for World University

renowned for its vibrant cultural life and its thriving creative
and tech industries. Austin is routinely included in top-ten lists
of best US cities for new college grads, for young professionals,

opportunity/affirmative action employer, complies with all
applicable federal and state laws regarding nondiscrimination and
affirmative action. The University is committed to a policy of

controversial, we value accomplished designers and researchers
deeply committed to creating meaningful, data-oriented, and
human-driven experiences and services that balance the
opportunities for value creation for multiple organization
stakeholders with the threats inherent in data processes and
governance. Strong ability to master data transformations using
different methods and languages across multiple disciplines—along
with leveraging a broader framework to advance the field of design
research and scholarship—is also required.

We encourage candidates whose research creates value for a wide
range of firms and non-profit organizations by:

creating new methodologies for making data accessible, meaningful,
and actionable;

capturing, processing, and visualizing data effectively to inform

design;

creating data-driven design applications that incorporate consumer
insights to inform new product and service development;

designing for business processes, given decreasing data capture
costs; and

questioning and inventing new norms of ethical data use.

Qualifications:

degree by the appointment start date in visual, interactive,
experience, or information design, and or marketing, management, or
related fields that ensure the ability to transform data into
meaningful experiences. Applicants should have expertise in one or
more areas of design practice or business management, an
outstanding active research record, a research agenda that aligns
with University and College strategic areas, and a willingness to
collaborate across the University.


Preferred Qualifications:
Evidence of a high level of skill and accomplishment across media,
provocative meaning-making, a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility,
and a strong publication and exhibition record is required.
Candidates should have a well-developed research agenda that will
inform and advance current trends in the field and potentially
contribute in unique ways to furthering the reputation of CAMD and
DMSB.

Candidates should have a strong interest in interdisciplinary
collaboration and experience in or a commitment to working with
diverse student populations in a culturally diverse work and
educational environment. Successful applicants will demonstrate
potential for having a national and international record of
excellence in creative practice, innovative research, substantive
scholarship, and effective teaching.

Salary will be determined, commensurate with experience.

Additional Information:
All applications must be submitted electronically at https://careers.hrm.northeastern.edu.

research statement that includes a link to a portfolio of research
and professional outcomes, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and

this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,

with issues of race, equity, and justice, with a focus on
historically marginalized communities that have been
underrepresented or understudied in the design or scholarly
discourse of the built environment (e.g. Black, Latinx, Indigenous,

or other colleges in allied disciplines such as urban planning,
public policy, history, sociology, and anthropology depending on
the candidate's interest and expertise. There is also potential to
work with colleagues in other disciplines through Northeastern's
growing network of research centers and labs, including but not
limited to our Global Resilience Institute, Institute on Race and
Justice, the Africana Studies Center, Dukakis Center for Urban and
Regional Policy, and Institute for Health Equity and Social Justice
Research. We are proud to announce this position as part of a
cluster of hires within the College of Arts, Media, and Design and
the College of Social Sciences and Humanities dedicated to
deepening the university's commitment to race, social justice, and
equity campus-wide. Candidates should be committed to fostering
diverse and inclusive environments as well as promoting
experiential learning, both central to a Northeastern University
education.

Qualifications:
We seek applicants from academia and practice. Successful
candidates will have at minimum a master's degrees in Architecture
or allied fields (e.g. M. Arch., MLA, MFA, or Master of Urban
Planning) by the appointment start date.

Associate/Full Professor - Director, Microbiome Center

The Pennsylvania State University is seeking a Full or Associate
Professor of Microbiome Sciences and Director for the Penn State
Microbiome Center (https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/research/microbiome-center),
located on the University Park Campus.

The Penn State Microbiome Center is one of the largest and most
active microbiome research and education centers in the U.S. The
center was established in 2017 to foster transformative,
cross-college interdisciplinary research and to provide
infrastructure and resources needed for increasing diversity and
breadth of interdisciplinary microbiome research at Penn State. The
center is part of the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, which
exists to strengthen interdisciplinary life science research and
graduate education campus wide. Faculty, students, and staff
associated with the Penn State Microbiome Center come from 9
colleges, 16 campuses, and 3 institutes. We are seeking a new Penn
State Microbiome Center Director to lead the center through its
next phase of growth and development and to fulfill its vision of
becoming an international leader in microbiome research and
education.

The Director is expected to have an established track record of
successful extramural funding, publishing results from
multidisciplinary research projects, and evidence of leadership of
multidisciplinary scientific teams. The Director appointment will
be a 50/50 split between Center leadership and research. The
Department and College tenure home is open for negotiation based on
research interests and could be in one or more of the following
colleges: College of Agricultural Sciences, College of Earth and
Mineral Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Health and
Human Development, College of Information Sciences and Technology,

and the Eberly College of Science. There is an expectation that the
candidate be appointed to one or more Interdomain Graduate
Programs. The Microbiome Center Director will report to the
director of the Huck Institutes for the Life Sciences. This
structure will provide the director with administrative and staff
support, and allow the director to have visibility at the highest
levels within the University. It also provides a unique opportunity
to create programs and research directions at disciplinary
boundaries, capturing diverse perspectives and ensuring the
benefits of microbiome research across all aspects of society. Penn
State consistently ranks among the nation's top 25 public research
universities, with fiscal year 2020 research expenditures exceeding
$1 billion.

In addition to establishing a rigorous externally funded research
program in any aspect of microbiomes at Penn State, duties also
include the following:

Promote a culture of excellence in microbiome intersectional
research, teaching, and outreach across the University; Establish
Penn State as a global leader in interdisciplinary microbiome
research; Continue the growth of the Penn State Microbiome Center
through strategic initiatives and development of collaborative,
interdisciplinary research teams; Support the training of next
generation of microbiome researchers via classroom and experiential
learning opportunities; Obtain philanthropic and grant funding to
insure financial sustainability of the Penn State Microbiome
Center; Lead the Microbiome Center Executive Committee to develop
and execute a strategic vision and approaches for the center;
Ensure that faculty at all campuses have access to the resources of
the center; Engage current Penn State faculty, postdoctoral fellow,
and student members of the Microbiome Center to shape its future;
Actively engage in mentorship of early career faculty hired in
association with the Center; and Foster and increase diversity at
the student, staff, postdoctoral and faculty levels.

A Ph.D. in any microbiome science related field is required. The
applicant should have an academic track record commensurate with
the level of Full Professor with tenure, although exceptional
applications at the Associate level will be considered. The
successful applicant will join faculty members with complementary,
interdisciplinary research interests, and have access to excellent
core facilities https://www.huck.psu.edu/core-facilities.

Please submit a cover letter, CV, Research Statement, Teaching
Statement, Leadership Philosophy Statement and the names and
contact information for three references. Applicants should provide
evidence, either woven through their application materials or as a
separate diversity statement, of a commitment to fostering
diversity, equity, inclusive excellence, and belonging and of
engagement which creates an inclusive environment in their
research, classroom, department, and the University. For more
information about the position, please contact Andrew Read,
Director of the Huck Institutes at afr3@psu.edu or Carolee Bull,
Director of the Penn State Microbiome Center at
ctb14@psu.edu.

Review of applicants will begin on June 21, 2021.

Penn State is committed to and accountable for advancing diversity,
equity, and inclusion in all its forms and, by definition,
sustainability cannot be achieved unless it is achieved for all
people. As such, we believe that equity is a core concept of
sustainability, and that our work must be inclusive and embrace
diversity.

community of good neighbors and engaged citizens. While the city of

Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.

underrepresented racial minority students, and a record of service
activities that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Strong
candidates will also have experience with or the desire to engage
in interdisciplinary conversations and scholarship across UCSD

inequalities with respect to race, economic disadvantage, language
status, disability, or other factors in producing educational
inequalities
leveraging interdependencies of schools, city systems, and
agencies (e.g., health, justice, housing) to improve youth
development and well-being
promoting the production and use of evidence in educational
