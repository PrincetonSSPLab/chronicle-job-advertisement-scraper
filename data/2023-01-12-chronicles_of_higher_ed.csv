As a signatory of the Scarborough Charter on Anti-Black Racism and Black Inclusion, Dalhousie has committed to taking decisive action to recruit Black scholars to the university and to employ best practices to support their retention and advancement. This commitment is expressed in our Strategic Plan’s second pillar, Inclusive Excellence. In keeping with these commitments and our institutional drive and obligation to enrich our research, teaching, and learning environment and community engagement, Dalhousie invites applications for the below position.

This opportunity is part of a cluster hiring initiative supported by the Dalhousie Diversity Faculty Award (DDFA) program. In keeping with the principles of employment equity, the DDFA program aims to correct historic underrepresentation. This initiative will support inclusive excellence by appointing 5 Black scholars to the university across multiple disciplines. Cluster hires promote interdisciplinary collaboration, while creating communities of support for scholars from underrepresented groups. These new scholars will find opportunities for scholarly contributions, collaboration, and support as Fellows of the newly established Black Studies Research Institute and will contribute to our emerging transdisciplinary program in Black and African Diaspora Studies (BAFD).
Further information about this initiative may be found here https://www.dal.ca/dept/senior-administration/provost-vp-academic/inclusive-hiring.html.

The Faculty of Management at Dalhousie invites applications for a probationary tenure-track, tenure-track or tenured appointment at the rank of Lecturer, Assistant, Associate or full Professor in the areas of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. We are especially interested in applications from scholars whose work will advance teaching, research and innovation-based extra-curricular activities aligned with the Faculty’s inclusive innovation mandate, which aims to service graduate and undergraduate students university-wide. Applicants will also have the opportunity to participate in Dalhousie’s Black Studies Research Institute and to teach in Dalhousie’s new major in Black and African Diaspora Studies.

The applicant must have a Masters degree in a relevant discipline and be committed to completing a PhD in a relevant discipline, or already have a PhD. Applicants who do not yet have a PhD may be offered a deferred start date in order to complete their PhD before taking up the position. This deferral also includes the possibility of a limited-term appointment at a lower FTE during PhD completion. These details are open to negotiation and to the best approach for both the successful candidate and the Faculty of Management. Applicants should have an outstanding academic record, a record of scholarly engagement, and a commitment to teaching excellence (or demonstrated teaching excellence for applicants already holding an academic appointment).
The Faculty of Management has a long history of providing a world-class education and supporting innovative research leaders. A leader in experiential and work-integrated learning, we’re focused on being responsive to the world around us. Our research is relevant not just in our core areas, but also stretches across the University to fields like health, psychology, humanities, engineering, law, computer science, oceans, and agriculture. We are an inclusive community driven by curiosity, integrity, and discovery. We welcome and celebrate diverse perspectives.
With more than 2500 students (over one-quarter graduate students) and 80 faculty members, we offer undergraduate programs (Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Management) and graduate programs (direct-entry and mid-career versions of the Master of Information, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Public Administration; and the Master of Science in Business). All of our degree programs are externally accredited. We actively participate in Dalhousie’s Interdisciplinary PhD program and the multi-Faculty Master of Digital Innovation.

Dalhousie University is among Canada’s U15 group of leading research-oriented universities. We are located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada a city known for its great quality of life. Located in one of Canada’s more temperate areas, Nova Scotia gets warm, sunny summers; long, colorful autumns; and cool, snowy winters.
 

Information about the Faculty of Management may be found here: https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management.html
 
Dalhousie University is located in Nova Scotia, Canada (Mi’kma’ki) with four campuses in Halifax and Truro, and satellite locations in Yarmouth and Saint John, New Brunswick. As Atlantic Canada’s primary research-intensive university and a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Universities, our 13 academic Faculties expand understanding through teaching excellence and a drive for discovery that results in more than $214 million in research funding each year.

Each year, Dalhousie welcomes almost 21,000 students from more than 115 countries around the world. A diverse population of Black students call Dalhousie home, including those from African Nova Scotian, Black/African Canadian, and international communities. The United Nations recognized African Canadians as a distinct group and Dalhousie acknowledges African Nova Scotians as a distinct people who have shaped the province and the university for centuries. In 2018, Dalhousie launched the African Nova Scotian Strategy, which was then further updated in 2021 through the work of the strategy’s working group, which includes Dalhousie’s Director of African Nova Scotian Community Engagement. The Strategy is aimed at ensuring sustainable initiatives that support African Nova Scotian students, staff, and faculty members.

Dalhousie has a strong history of introducing ground-breaking initiatives that have created many opportunities for Black students including the Indigenous Blacks & Mi’kmaq Initiative at the Schulich School of Law and Promoting Leadership in Health for African Nova Scotians program. The university has also developed strong ties to several organizations serving that community, for example to the African Canadian Services Branch of the Department of Education – the only such branch in Canada serving Black students in K-12, to the Delmore Buddy Daye Learning Institute and to the Afrocentric Math cohort at Auburn High school.
 
In 1970, Dalhousie established the Transition year Program (TYP), which provides opportunities for individuals who may face barriers to post-secondary education to prepare for all aspects of academic life and gain access to the university. Nearly two decades ago, Imhotep’s Legacy Academy was established, an innovative university-community partnership designed to create pathways into STEM for students of African descent.
Dalhousie established the James R. Johnston (JRJ) Chair in Black Canadian Studies in 1991 which was at the time, the only endowed Black Studies Chair at a Canadian university. The current Chair, Dr. OmiSoore Dryden, recently established the Black Studies Research Institute (BSRI), a pan-university institute centering transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in Black studies. The BSRI will intersect closely with the university’s minor in Black and African Diaspora Studies, developed by former JRJ Chair Dr. Afua Cooper, and the university is now working on a proposal for a full degree program, the development of which is being championed by members of Dalhousie’s Black Faculty and Staff Caucus and supported by senior leaders across the university.
 
Dalhousie was also the first in Canada to join the Universities Studying Slavery group of institutions, out of which the Lord Dalhousie Report was published. Recommendations led to the Sankofa scholarships, renaming of streets to reflect the Black contribution to Canada and a concerted plan in our international strategy to form even more meaningful educational partnerships with the Caribbean.
 
As a signatory of the Scarborough Charter, and in keeping with these long-standing institutional commitments to recruiting and supporting Black faculty, staff, and students across the university, Dalhousie is now in an excellent position to support this cluster hiring initiative and candidates will enter a Faculty and university that has demonstrated outstanding and unique support for Black faculty and students.
 
More information about Dalhousie may be found here: www.dal.ca

Cover letter Recent Curriculum Vitae Research Statement (one (1) page, reflective of your substantive research focus and the methodological approaches that you use to address your research) Teaching Statement (one (1) page, reflective of your teaching philosophy and teaching interests) If applicable, evidence of teaching effectiveness and experience such as teaching evaluations, letters from colleagues or students, and/or research related to the scholarship of teaching and learning (If no such documents are available, please re-upload the teaching statement here.)

This position is designated to candidates who self-identify as persons of Black/African descent, especially African Nova Scotians. All such qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority. Dalhousie recognizes that candidates may self-identify in more than one equity-deserving group, and in this spirit, we encourage applications from candidates who (in addition to being of Black/African descent) also identify as Indigenous persons (especially Mi’kmaq), members of other racialized groups, women, persons with a disability, and/or members of 2SLGBTQ+ communities.

Our award-winning programs offer professional degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels in Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning; at the undergraduate level in Art History and Visual Communication Design; and at the graduate level in Regenerative Studies. Faculty research, professional and creative activities are brought into the classroom through the Teacher-Scholar Model. Support and recognition for faculty efforts facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and promote their rich talent, expertise, and influence.

widely for the field of landscape architecture in a time of change,
and whose research expands the relationship between the physical
space of landscape and the necessity of digital techniques. More
specifically, the program seeks scholars and practitioners who can
advance a critical agenda on the practical use of geospatial data
under the broad research categories including but not limited to:
ecology as it relates to citizen science, the role of climate
change statistics in environmental decision-making, remote sensing
in relation to labor markets, the inequities of cartography, and
the nuanced application of integrated processing systems, open
source spatial resolutions, and public engagement platforms among
others.

MLA CURRICULUM

The Masters in Landscape Architecture is structured as a three year
program, with the first two years functioning as a core curriculum,
and the third year focused on professional practice.The first year
core lays the foundation to the field through regional scale
analysis, introducing students to landscape planning, public
shorelines, botany, field ecology, cartography and the theory of
evolution.The second year core integrates the critical parameters
of the Borough of Brooklyn and the community scale , through garden
and park making. Students explore the role of landscape through
respectful engagement, and applied fieldwork in the context of one
of the most diverse human and non-human communities in America. The
third year focuses on how landscape research integrates with other
professions, outlooks and methods by working broadly across other
Departments at the School of Architecture and Pratt Institute,
challenging students to define their work by applying core lessons
from first and second year to the expansion of professional
practice and the public nature of construction documentation.

candidates who understand the barriers facing historically
oppressed groups in PK-12 and higher education (as evidenced by
life experiences and educational background) and who can clearly
articulate participation in equity and diversity advancement
efforts with respect to teaching, mentoring, research, and service
towards building an equitable and scholarly environment. Activities
promoting equity and inclusion at UC Santa Cruz will be recognized
as important university service during the faculty promotion
process. More information can be found: https://apo.ucsc.edu/diversity.html

representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten

representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

Description
The Department of Geography at San Diego State University (SDSU) is
hiring a tenure-track Assistant Professor with expertise in the
areas of urban and environmental health
to begin in Fall 2023. We are specifically looking for candidates
whose research addresses the interconnected global crises of
environmental degradation, climate change, migration, and racial
and social inequalities and examines their relationships to
individual, community, or population health in urban contexts. The
successful candidate will be well versed in geographic and
interdisciplinary perspectives on both environmental health and
urban contexts and will share our broad understanding of health as
physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being influenced by
place and space. We are open to all methodological approaches but
will give preference to candidates with experience in innovative
and creative mixed and/or qualitative methods of gathering and
analyzing rich and diverse types of data that emphasize the
significance of geography in shaping health.

Candidates must have a demonstrated research focus on environmental
health geography in urban contexts and a commitment to working with
diverse groups through research, teaching, mentoring, and service.
Research expertise could include but is not limited to
environmental racism, environmental justice, climate migration,
climate-related health impacts, demography, health disparities,
structural violence, food justice, urban solidarity movements,
urban development, community health, air quality, happiness and
quality of life, social reproduction, trauma, embodiment, political
ecology of the body, therapeutic landscapes, sustainable cities,
and child friendly cities in urban settings anywhere in the
world.

Given the growing diversity of fields that are contributing to
better understandings of urban and environmental health issues,
applicant disciplines may include but are not limited to the fields
of geography, anthropology, public health, ethnic studies,
sociology, urban studies, environmental studies, or food
studies.

Faculty in the Department of Geography specialize in urban,
environmental, and physical geography and geographic information
science (see our website
for additional information). Areas of expertise complementing the
candidate's include social movements, food geographies, climate
adaptation, children's geographies, migration, water quality,
human-environment interaction and dynamics, climate change, public
health, media geographies, and gentrification. The successful
candidate will be expected to contribute to the Sustainability,
Urban Studies, and/or Food Studies programs, whose
interdisciplinary majors and/or minors depend heavily on teaching,
mentoring, and advising by geography faculty.


Qualifications
Candidates must have a doctoral degree in geography or related
discipline and a research and funding record of accomplishment that
demonstrates their ability to establish a clear program of
research. A history of experience with extramural funding from
federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, USDA) is preferred. Ideally,
candidates would have experience conducting research in
interdisciplinary environments. The Department of Geography and the
University will provide structured faculty development to assist
faculty in achieving success as independent researchers through
research training opportunities, community building among
interdisciplinary researchers, and mentorship support as faculty
work to establish their program of teaching, research, and service
at SDSU.

Teaching experience at the undergraduate and graduate levels is
desired but not required. Candidates should have a demonstrated
interest in teaching and mentoring students at the undergraduate
and graduate level, including master and doctoral students in
geography.

We are seeking applicants with demonstrated experience in and/or
commitment to teaching and working effectively with individuals
from diverse backgrounds and members of underrepresented groups.
Candidates must satisfy two or more of the eight Building on
Inclusive Excellence (BIE) criteria. Candidates that meet BIE
criteria: (a) are committed to engaging in service with
underrepresented populations within the discipline, (b) have

diversity statement how you meet at least two (2) of these
criteria. Additional guidance on our BIE program for applicants is
here.

SDSU’s Vibrant Research Environment

Collaborative, transdisciplinary, and trans-border research
opportunities abound at SDSU. SDSU is home to many Centers and
Institutes focused on the health of underrepresented
communities, with opportunities for community collaboration through
the Center for Regional
Sustainability. As a large and socially diverse city located
along the US-Mexico border, San Diego serves as an ideal hub for
research on urban and environmental health issues, with many
opportunities for collaboration in applied and community-based
research, including work with newly arrived immigrants and refugees
from many countries and Native American tribes and bands who have
lived in the area since time immemorial.

SDSU is home to a diverse student and faculty body. Over a third of
our approximately 36,000 students, both undergraduate and graduate,
are from underrepresented communities. SDSU is the oldest
institution of higher education in the San Diego region, with a
campus and microsites in San Diego and locations in Southern
California’s Imperial Valley and Tbilisi in the Republic of
Georgia. The highly diverse campus community has a student
population of approximately 36,000. SDSU is included in the
Carnegie Foundation’s Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity
category. Established in 1897, SDSU offers bachelor degrees in 97
areas, masters in 84 and doctorates in 23. See http://www.sdsu.edu for more
information. SDSU is a large, diverse, urban university and
Hispanic-Serving Institution with a commitment to diversity,
equity, and inclusive excellence. Our campus community is diverse
in many ways, including race, religion, color, sex, age,
disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, national origin, pregnancy, medical condition, and
covered veteran status. We strive to build and sustain a welcoming
environment for all.

SDSU strives for equity and inclusion in everything it does,
building on the human and intellectual diversity of students,
faculty, and staff as a source of innovation and strength. SDSU is
ranked 35 nationwide for ethnic diversity, and roughly 54 percent
of the university's undergraduates and graduates are students from
historically marginalized populations. SDSU is the No. 1
LGBTQ+-friendly campus in California, and No. 8 nationally,
according to Campus Pride and BestColleges. ​Further, the
university is consistently ranked as a top school for veterans and
serves more than 4,000 military-connected students. As a
U.S.-Mexico transborder Hispanic Serving Institution, SDSU launched
its Inaugural Global Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish in Spring 2021
to value and honor the language of our California/Baja California
region. Most critically, the values of equity, diversity, and
inclusion translate to results: Continuation and degree completion
rates have increased over the last decade, and equity gaps have
begun to close effectively with individuals from diverse
backgrounds.

The SDSU Mission Valley Innovation District will offer
opportunities for collaboration and entrepreneurship, with 1.6
million square feet of planned research and innovation space that
will be developed primarily through public and private
partnerships. SDSU researchers and Innovation District partners
will work together to develop creative solutions to complex
problems. SDSU’s entrepreneurship programs have the potential to
catalyze the public impact of research discoveries.

CSULB seeks to recruit faculty who enthusiastically support the
University's strong commitment to the academic success of all of
our students, including students of color, students with

as a reflection of our commitment to serve the People of
California, to maintain the excellence of the University, and to
offer our students a rich variety of expertise, perspectives, and

The School of Social Work is proud to be an integral part of a
university that is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution and
an Asian American and Native Pacific Islander Serving Institution
located in a city with a large Cambodian/Cambodian American
population in an aspirational context for increasing Black,
Indigenous and People of Color enrollment. The mission of the
School of Social Work is to educate and graduate diverse, ethical,
competent social work students able to think critically and use
evidence-based practice approaches to effectively serve culturally
diverse, vulnerable individuals, families and communities in a wide
variety of practice areas as practitioners, leaders and social
justice advocates.

Over the past 20 years, our Social Work faculty has assumed
leadership in attracting over $94 million dollars in extramural
funds and secured almost $21 million on behalf of local Long Beach
human services, community organizations and education settings. Our
curriculum prepares graduate students in three specialization
areas: child and family well-being, integrated health, and
adulthood and aging.

The School engages in collaborative, community-based research that
enhances the well-being of vulnerable populations and disadvantaged
communities. The School also engages students at both the bachelor
and graduate levels in curricula that recognizes the importance of
identifying that power and privilege can be a resource. Identifying
and recognizing how power and privilege can be leveraged as a
resource is important to advocate for and/or empower those who may
not have similar power and/or privilege. Our School hopes to
improve service delivery systems and contribute to social work
knowledge. Our School also provides service to the community and
the profession through the development of ongoing relationships
with various groups. Those include grassroots community leaders,
community-based non-profit organizations, governmental
organizations, and foundations.

Classification Title:

AST/ASO Professor

Job Description:

The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) invites
applications of interest for investigators in cancer and aging
research. We are seeking promising faculty at the
Assistant/Associate Professor level to fill gaps in current
knowledge in basic, clinical, and population sciences in cancer at
the intersection of aging. Appointments are on the tenure track,
and accompanied by significant resources to support faculty
research. This position will join a robust cohort of investigators
as part of the UFHCC Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS)
research program, led by Dejana Braithwaite, PhD, Associate
Director for Population Sciences. The mission of the CCPS program
is to reduce the cancer burden and associated risk factors in
Northern Florida and beyond.

Alongside the UFHCC, the University of Florida is home to the
Pepper Center for Older Americans, the Institute on Aging, and a
growing transdisciplinary research initiative on Cancer and Aging.
Embracing socio-ecological and biopsychosocial models, this
initiative seeks to transform the understanding of cancer and
aging. Outstanding opportunities exist to advance this initiative,
spanning basic science to clinical practice and policy; there are
also opportunities for clinician-researchers to establish clinical
services for older individuals with cancer.

Current research includes a robust portfolio of NIH or other
similar peer-reviewed funded studies in cancer control and
population sciences; healthy aging and biopsychosocial outcomes in
older populations at risk for or diagnosed with cancer; mechanisms
of accelerated aging; animal models of cancer and aging; and pilot
interventions to improve functioning. Other research focuses on
artificial intelligence approaches to cancer control and ‘real
world' data.

Applicants with interests in geroscience and gero-oncology, from
any scientific background, are encouraged to apply. This includes
but is not limited to researchers with expertise in preclinical
models, cellular senescence, frailty, pain, fatigue and functional
status, clinical medicine, epidemiology, treatment toxicity among
older patients with cancer, body composition and cancer outcomes in
older patients with cancer, quality of life issues prevalent in
older adulthood and exacerbated by cancer and its treatment, and
research to inform policy and practice for the growing and older
cancer population. We are interested in creative research that can
accelerate knowledge about how aging processes affect cancer risk,
early detection, treatment effectiveness and toxicity, and why
cancer and its treatments may promote aspects of aging. Other areas
of interest include minority aging, the role of Alzheimer's disease
and dementia in cancer-related outcomes, and innovative clinical
trials to maximize healthy aging.

Academic appointment will be in the appropriate College and
Department. Academic rank and tenure status will be commensurate
with experience and accomplishment. Compensation includes an
excellent benefits package.

The University of Florida, a member of the AAU, is the largest and
most comprehensive public university in the State of Florida, with
large undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate educational
programs. The UF Health Science Center and its six colleges are
co-located on the Gainesville campus, with additional teaching,

training (e.g. M.P.H., MS, or fellowship) in any of the disciplines
relevant to cancer and aging (e.g., cognitive aging, social
determinants of successful aging, internal/family medicine and
gerontology, neurobiology, neuropsychology, behavioral science,
health services research, epidemiology, health policy). Applicants
should have a track record of publications and extramural
funding.

Preferred Qualifications:

Job Description


Classification Title:

ASO/FULL PROF

Job Description:

The Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of
Florida invites applications for a tenured/tenure-track faculty
position at the rank of Associate or Full Professor for an Endowed
Professorship in the Department of Computer & Information
Science & Engineering (CISE).

Specific area recruiting for/brief description of duties. This
endowed professorship is to support a faculty leader in research on
ethical AI systems, including the development of AI methods and
their applications in CISE-related fields. The recipient will
conduct research at the intersection of technology and society with
the specific goal of recognizing and understanding potential harms
when AI algorithms are embedded in societal applications and the
mechanisms can be used for monitoring and control. The recipient
may also conduct research on how AI changes the nature of
human-technology interaction over time.

Major research thrust areas include but not limited to:

(1) Algorithmic fairness and development of socially
conscious/aware algorithms: There is an intrinsic trade-off between
computational accuracy and algorithm fairness (accounting for
societal context) in developing predictive tools. This
professorship will address contextual factors in algorithm
prototyping and development. A burgeoning area of research interest
is in “fairness gerrymandering” or the case in which an algorithm
appears fair across individual groups but a subgroup characteristic
leads to a heavy bias against one or more particular groups (e.g.,
uniform marketing of services across groups but with some groups
being incapable of using services).

(2) Algorithmic Interpretability: Many machine learning tools are
labeled as “black box algorithms” due to a lack of causal
explanation of how inputs are transformed to outputs. There is a
need for further understanding of causes and effects of changes
within a model to allow for transfer of machine learning into the
broader human knowledge base. Algorithm transparency is also
instrumental in guarding against embedded bias.

(3) Study of legal, ethical, and social consequences of AI-driven
technology and decision making.

The professorship may also support faculty research related to
ethics beyond AI, including data handling. Study of data privacy,
anonymization, and differential privacy (sharing information about
a dataset without revealing personal information of individuals)
are also considered within the scope of this appointment.

Expected Salary:

Salary to commensurate with education and experience.

Minimum Requirements:

PhD in Computer Science, or related field is required.

Preferred Qualifications:

The preferred candidate will have skills in, AI, Machine Learning,
Ethics, Bias

Special Instructions to Applicants:

capable of teaching any of the entry-level courses in our
curriculum and have a research area that enhances upper-level
courses in at least one of our tracks: applied, pure, education,
and statistics. We are particularly interested in candidates who
employ student-centered pedagogical practices, who are versed in
culturally responsive teaching, and who exhibit awareness of and
appreciation for epistemic diversity. In addition to a record of
outstanding teaching, University Fellows are expected to engage in
departmental service and maintain scholarly activity.

University Fellows Program Mission
UNC Asheville is among the nation's best public liberal arts &
sciences colleges and the only designated liberal arts institution
in the North Carolina university system. We are the founders of the
National Conference on Undergraduate Research and our students and
faculty helped to design, fabricate, and install the largest public
art installation ever shown in Times Square, collaborating side by
side with a recent McArthur genius award winner. We offer an
extraordinary liberal arts education at an incredibly affordable
rate (tuition is under $7500 per year for in-state students), all
in the beautiful mountain town of Asheville, NC.
Our excellence is first and foremost a product of a faculty deeply
committed to both teaching and scholarship in their discipline.
That excellence also demands that our curriculum, co-curricular
activities, and entire community welcome, reflect, and celebrate a
diversity of perspectives, lived experiences, and identities.
Currently, our required core curriculum includes diversity
intensive courses and we offer living learning communities
specifically designed for students of color, but we have
prioritized doing more. Just this fall, we released a Racial
Justice Roadmap that will serve as a guide to the work in which we
will be engaging to become an even more inclusive campus. That
Racial Justice Roadmap includes initiatives that span student
affairs, admissions and financial aid, and critically important,
academic affairs.
In particular, to support the development of a more excellent and
diverse professoriate at UNC Asheville, we are launching the
University Fellowship for Faculty Diversity (University Fellows)
Program. The program invites pre-doctoral and post-doctoral
candidates specifically considering careers at a liberal arts
institution which takes equal pride in the excellence of its
faculty's teaching and the quality of its faculty's scholarship and
creative production. UNC Asheville is looking for candidates who
are able to help us advance one of our most important strategic
objectives--to develop, maintain, and support a faculty whose
diversity more closely represents the demographics of the nation
and the state of NC, particularly with respect to race, with
special attention to domestic underrepresentation of minorities in
various disciplines.
University Fellows Program Details
Faculty at the University of North Carolina Asheville ordinarily
teach 24 credit hours per year. University Fellows will have a
lightened teaching load, receive extensive mentorship, and receive
support for the development of their pedagogy and disciplinary
work.
In particular, University Fellows should expect to teach as few as
three courses in their first year and will receive funds for
professional development and research and/or creative production
(to be arranged at the time of being awarded the fellowship).
Salaries for pre-doctoral fellows before earning their degree will
be commensurate with lecturers in the discipline; salaries for
fellows who have earned their degree will be commensurate with
visiting assistant professors.
By early fall of a University Fellow's final year, it will be
determined whether a tenure track offer will be made to the faculty
member. In the event that an offer is not made or the tenure track
position is not one that the fellow would like to accept, we will
support the Fellow in the best ways possible in applying for a
tenure track position elsewhere.
A few other details about each fellowship (pre-doctoral vs.
post-doctoral) are summarized below:
Pre-doctoral:
Three year term
Course Release:
Teach 12 credit hours over the first year (12 credit hours of
release over the first year, not all to be taken in one semester).
Four to six credit hours of release over the next two years.
Expectation is to complete the terminal degree by the end of year
one. There may be opportunities that warrant consideration of
completion beyond the first year, but these will be considered on a
case by case basis. Salary increase, subject to budget and System
Office constraints, will take place the year subsequent to
completion of the degree.
Post-doctoral:
Two or Three year term

COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND DIVERSITY

With the goal of ensuring the equal educational opportunity of all
students, Santa Monica College embraces diversity among students,
faculty, staff, and the communities we serve as an integral part of
our history, a recognition of the complexity of our present state,
and a call to action for a better future. Embracing diversity means
that we must intentionally practice equity and respect toward one
another, and understand that discrimination and prejudices create
and sustain privileges for some while creating and sustaining
barriers for others. In order to embrace diversity, we also
acknowledge that institutional discrimination and implicit bias
exist, and that our goal is to eradicate those vestiges from our
system. Our commitment to diversity requires that we strive to
eliminate those barriers to equity, and that we act deliberately to
create a safe and positive environment where individual and group
differences are valued and leveraged for our growth and
understanding as an educational community.

To advance the goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and social
justice for the success of students and employees, we must honor
that each individual is unique and that our individual differences
contribute to the ability of the college to prepare students on
their educational journeys. This requires that we develop and
implement policies and procedures, encourage individual and
systemic change, continually reflect on our efforts, and hold
ourselves accountable for the results of our efforts in
accomplishing our goals.

We are invested as a community in cultivating and maintaining a
climate where equity and mutual respect are both intrinsic and
explicit by valuing individuals and groups from all backgrounds,
demographics, and experiences. Individual and group differences can
include, but are not limited to the following dimensions: race,
ethnicity, national origin or ancestry, citizenship, immigration
status, sex, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental
disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status,
registered domestic partner status, age, religion, creed, military
or veteran status, socioeconomic status, and any other basis
protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or
regulation. We acknowledge that the concept of inclusion and
diversity is ever-evolving, thus we create space to allow our
understanding to grow through the periodic review of this
statement. In service of these goals, Santa Monica College is
committed to fostering an employment environment that offers equal
employment opportunity for all and an educational environment that
ensures the equal educational opportunity of all students.
