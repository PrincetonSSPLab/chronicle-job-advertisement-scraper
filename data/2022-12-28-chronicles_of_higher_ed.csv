Description
The San Diego State University (SDSU) Department of Biology seeks
to hire one tenured/tenure-track faculty member at the Associate or
Full Professor rank with expertise in the area of Cancer Biology
research to begin Fall 2023. This position is part of a cluster of
11 faculty hired across the SDSU and SDSU Imperial Valley campuses
and is a component of the SDSU FUERTE (Faculty Unified towards
Excellence in Research and Transformational Engagement) program,
which is funded by the National Institutes of Health FIRST program
(NIH Award Number: U54CA267789). This position will be at the SDSU
campus in San Diego, California. As of August 2022, nine faculty
have been hired for the FUERTE program.

SDSU seeks to complete ​the recruitment of a diverse cohort of
cancer research colleagues from a broad range of disciplines and a
variety of academic and research backgrounds; therefore, candidates
must have a demonstrated research focus on cancer biology and
cancer health disparities research and a commitment to working with
diverse groups (e.g., Latinx, Black/African American, American
Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, Asian, Pacific
Islander, LGBTQI, etc.) through research, teaching, mentoring, and
service.

Individuals working in any area of cancer biology are invited to
apply. Research expertise could include biochemical and biophysical
mechanisms of cancer development and progression; molecular
features of tumor metabolism or DNA repair; tumor biology and
microenvironment; cancer immunology and virology; and the role of
the microbiome in cancer initiation, progression, and response to
therapy. Candidates whose research focus is upon a cancer that
shows health disparities in our local catchment area are especially
encouraged to apply.

Cancer research at SDSU is further facilitated by extensive
interaction with the UCSD Moores Cancer Center, with whom SDSU is a
consortium partner. The successful faculty member will be eligible
for membership in the Cancer Center and will be encouraged to work
collaboratively with UCSD faculty to further strengthen this
partnership.


Qualifications
Associate or Full Professor Position: Candidates should have
significant demonstrated experience conducting research in
interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and/or transdisciplinary
environments as well as a strong record of extramural funding.
Teaching experience at the undergraduate and graduate levels is
preferred. The incumbent is also expected to serve as a member of
the mentoring team to help mentor the three Assistant Professors
hired in Fall 2022 as part of the cancer and cancer disparities
cluster hired through the FUERTE program. An appointment with
Tenure will be considered for candidates with an advanced academic
and research record and with approval from the department and the
Provost.

Candidates must hold a doctoral degree (e.g., Ph.D., Sc.D., etc.)
and are expected to make significant contributions to the scholarly
literature. SDSU is home to a wide variety of student research
support programs that facilitate faculty engagement of students and
postdoctoral trainees in research. Research opportunities for
underrepresented students at the undergraduate and graduate levels
are highly encouraged.

SDSU FUERTE was funded as part of the NIH Faculty Institutional
Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program to
promote scientific workforce diversity and build a community of
scientists committed to implementing and sustaining cultures of
inclusive excellence through recruitment of a diverse cohort of
early-career faculty (Grant # NIH Award Number: U54CA267789). Given
SDSU’s federal designation as an Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI)
in 2012 and recent designation as an Asian American and Native
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), SDSU
FUERTE is committed to elevating the health and wellbeing of Latinx
and other underrepresented communities through the support of a
diverse research workforce.

We are seeking applicants with demonstrated experience in and/or
commitment to teaching and working effectively with individuals
from diverse backgrounds and members of underrepresented groups.

SDSU’s Vibrant Research Environment

Collaborative, transdisciplinary, and trans-border research
opportunities abound at SDSU as well as at our two Imperial Valley
campuses (Brawley and
Calexico). For example, SDSU is home to one large NIH cooperative
agreement, the SDSU
HealthLINK Center, as well as many other Centers and Institutes
focused on the health of underrepresented communities (SDSU Centers and
Institutes). SDSU Imperial Valley is home to the recently
established 
RISE Center. San Diego serves as an ideal hub for basic and
applied cancer research with opportunities for collaboration beyond
SDSU, including the County of San Diego Health and Human Services
Agency, UCSD, Moores Cancer Center, USD, CSU San Marcos,
Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Scripps Whittier
Diabetes Institute, Scripps Research Translation Institute, Salk
Institute, Sanford Burnham Prebys, local pharmaceutical and biotech
industries, Federally Qualified Health Centers, etc. SDSU is home
to a diverse student and faculty body. Over a third of our
students, both undergraduate and graduate, are underrepresented
minorities. SDSU is approximately 40 minutes from the U.S.-Mexico
border and has a trolley line that extends directly to the border
crossing to Mexico, thus facilitating research collaboration with
faculty and students from universities in Tijuana. The San Diego
region is a large metropolitan area with a wide range of diverse
communities, which include newly arrived immigrants and refugees
from many countries, and centuries-old Native American tribes and
bands.

SDSU is the oldest institution of higher education in the San Diego
region, with a campus and microsites in San Diego and locations in
Southern California’s Imperial Valley and Tbilisi in the Republic
of Georgia. The highly diverse campus community has a student
population of approximately 36,000. SDSU is included in the
Carnegie Foundation’s Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity
category. Established in 1897, SDSU offers bachelor degrees in 97
areas, masters in 84 and doctorates in 23. See http://www.sdsu.edu for more
information. SDSU is a large, diverse, urban university and HSI
with a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence.
Our campus community is diverse in many ways, including race,
religion, color, sex, age, disability, marital status, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, national origin,
pregnancy, medical condition, and covered veteran status. We strive
to build and sustain a welcoming environment for all.

SDSU strives for equity and inclusion in everything it does,
building on the human and intellectual diversity of students,
faculty, and staff as a source of innovation and strength. SDSU is
ranked 35 nationwide for ethnic diversity, and roughly 54% of the
university's undergraduates and graduates are students from
historically marginalized populations. SDSU is the No. 1
LGBTQ+-friendly campus in California, and No. 8 nationally,
according to Campus Pride and BestColleges. ​Further, the
university is consistently ranked as a top school for veterans and
serves more than 4,000 military-connected students. As a
U.S.-Mexico transborder HSI, SDSU launched its Inaugural Global
Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish in Spring 2021 to value and honor the
language of our California/Baja California region. Most critically,
the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion translate to
results: Continuation and degree completion rates have increased
over the last decade, and equity gaps have begun to close
effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.

The SDSU Mission Valley Innovation District offers new
opportunities for collaboration and entrepreneurship, with 1.6
million square feet of research and innovation space that will be
developed primarily through public and private partnerships. SDSU
researchers and Innovation District partners will work together to
develop creative solutions to complex problems. SDSU’s
entrepreneurship programs catalyze the public impact of research

About the Opportunity

Northeastern University is searching for multiple tenured and
tenure-track faculty candidates at all ranks (Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor, or Professor) as part of a coordinated
university-wide search in the broad research areas at the nexus of
food, water, and energy. The Food-Energy-Water Nexus has a complex
and intertwined influence on our everyday lives, with
socio-economic, medical, and environmental impacts across the
globe. Critical interdependencies are being laid bare, for example
as climate change-induced drought is decimating crops and shutting
down power plants for lack of cooling water, while at the same time
increasing electricity demand for air conditioning. Sustaining
these essential resources through the 21st century and avoiding
mass species extinction will require a deep understanding of the
interconnections between socio-technical and ecological systems as
well as innovations in reducing risks and improving resilience and
sustainability. This complex nexus with its different contributors
will need to adapt and evolve over time in response to changes
within our broad global ecosystem. Therefore, with research areas
from supply chain resilience to the blue economy, multi- and
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, architects,
designers, humanists, ecologists, social scientists, policy-makers,
ethicists, and economists working at the food-energy-water nexus
will tackle grand challenges to improve our world.

Faculty will have a primary tenure home department in one of the
following colleges: College of Engineering, College of Science,
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Arts, Media
and Design, or the D'Amore-McKim School of Business. A secondary
joint appointment in a different college or a different department

About the Opportunity

Northeastern University invites applications for multiple,
cross-disciplinary faculty positions at all ranks (Assistant
Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor) beginning academic
year 2023-24 in multiple research areas that encompass the broad
research area of Biological Systems and Solutions. These areas
include Experimental Biological Physics; Mechanobiology; Systems
Biology; Biomaterials; Sensors, Drugs, and Diagnostics.

In this era, it has become exceedingly apparent that discoveries
made in the physical sciences are critical for expanding our
fundamental understanding of life and transforming medicine. For
example, basic observations made in the study of RNA modifications
led to the development of a new class of vaccines that can be
rapidly designed and administered. The candidate is expected to
further existing knowledge or develop new, quantitative,
technologies that address important questions in biophysics at the
level of molecules, cells and tissues, or the sum of the parts
(systems biology). Topics include, but are not limited to,
unraveling physiological processes involved in disease, using
single-molecule tools to investigate the structure, function, and
dynamics of molecules, investigating the building blocks of life at
a single-cell level, and understanding biological regulation using
synthetic biology approaches.

The primary appointment for Experimental Biological Physics will be
in the College of Science Department of Physics, with possible
joint appointments in other departments including Bioengineering,
Biology, or Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Cross-disciplinary
research programs and appointments are encouraged within the
College, and across the University.

The primary appointment for the College of Engineering position(s)
will be in Bioengineering, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering,
or Chemical Engineering with possible joint appointments
encouraged.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations.

Responsibilities

Faculty members at Northeastern are expected to develop independent
research programs that attract external funding; teach courses at
the graduate and undergraduate level; supervise students and
postdocs in their area of research; and participate in service to
the department, university, and discipline. Candidates interested
in conducting high-impact research programs and committed to
teaching excellence in the broad areas above are encouraged to
apply.

Qualifications

A Ph.D. or terminal degree in a discipline relevant to one of the
representative areas of interest and the department of primary
appointment by the appointment start date is required. We encourage
applicants from a wide range of backgrounds, including academia and
industry.

Associate Professor, and/or Professor) as part of a coordinated
university-wide search in the broad research area of Sustainability
and Resilience. Recent events have highlighted the importance of
societies and ecological systems that are both sustainable and
resilient when confronted with enormous challenges such as (1)
climate change, (2) social and environmental injustice, (3)
biodiversity loss, and (4) global disruptions including war,
pandemics, or disasters. Global progress in these areas requires
transformative scholarship and leadership in many areas, including

design and construction (with emphasis on innovative infrastructure
designs, decarbonization, biological conservation and climate
justice), regulatory design that encourages social, political and
economic transitions (such as efficient and equitable uses of
resources, emphasis on renewables), and fair distribution of
burdens without undo impact on other species, the environment and
communities with environmental justice concerns. Additional areas
of emphasis include connectivity of global supply chains, the
future of work, development of inclusive workforces, life cycle
impacts of urban architecture including operational and embodied
carbon emissions, mitigation and adaptation of coastal ecosystems
and settlements, the interaction of genomes with their
environments, and the design of resilient and equitable communities
and cities. Candidates who employ research methods spanning
multiple disciplines and who intend to build interdisciplinary
research programs that center on justice and ecological integrity
are strongly encouraged to apply.

Faculty will have a primary tenure home department in one of the
following colleges: College of Engineering, College of Social

challenges and focused on transformative impact for
humankind.

About the Opportunity:

The College of Science at Northeastern University invites
applications for positions at all ranks (Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor, or Professor), beginning in academic year
2023-2024 in the field of Sustainable Blue Economies broadly
defined. Primary appointments will be in Marine and Environmental
Sciences with joint appointments in other departments including the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Department
of Psychology, and/or the D'Amore-McKim School of Business.
Appointments will have the opportunity to collaborate in
cross-disciplinary teams across the University and will complement
existing strengths.

This opportunity is part of a broader Food, Water, Energy Nexus
thematic search. If interested in other opportunities under the
Food, Water, Energy Nexus theme, click here: 
Open Rank Faculty Search: Cross Disciplinary Search- Food, Energy,
Water Nexus

The College comprises six departments: Biology, Chemistry and
Chemical Biology, Marine and Environmental Sciences, Mathematics,
Physics, and Psychology. Cross-disciplinary research programs and
appointments are strongly encouraged within the College, and across
the University.

Seafood presently accounts for 17% of global protein intake and
with projected population growth, this reliance will exceed 70%.
Demand will be increasingly difficult to meet given that 60% of the
world's largest natural fisheries are already heavily or
over-exploited. Aquaculture accounts for almost half of global
seafood production, but the market is dominated by China with the
US efforts contributing an anemic 2% to the global market.
Sustainable Blue Economies represent a transformative
opportunity for the US market, but macroscale (climate change) and
local impacts, including social-political barriers that emerge
because of coastal pollution from aquaculture operations, will
continue to stymie progress. Overcoming this viscosity will require
multidisciplinary collaborations involving natural, social and
cognitive scientists, engineers, political scientists and decision
makers, and private sector incubators and stakeholders. We seek the
broad expertise necessary to enhance the security and
sustainability of coastal food production through aquaculture,
including but not limited to: fisheries science; sensitivity of
marine species to climate change; ecological and evolutionary
genomics; social, economic and cognitive barriers to the adoption
of aquaculture; and innovative financing and engineering solutions
to sustainable aquaculture productivity.

The Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES, https://cos.northeastern.edu/marine-environmental-sciences/)
includes 21 tenured/tenure-track faculty and 7 Research or Teaching
Professors, 43% of whom are women and/or from underrepresented
groups. MES embraces interdisciplinary teaching and research and
counts 10 faculty among it ranks that have joint appointments in
other colleges or departments. The Department currently supports
approximately 500 undergraduate majors in Environmental and
Sustainability Science, Environmental Studies, Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, and Marine Biology. In addition, MES enrolls
more than 150 students in its Masters Programs in Environmental
Science and Policy and Marine Biology and 35 students in its PhD
program in Marine and Environmental Sciences. In partnership with
the Coastal Sustainability Institute and Marine Science Center, the
MES community continues to lead the way in creating new knowledge
and innovative solutions that promote cleaner, safer, smarter and
more equitable coastal communities.

Northeastern is home to the Coastal
Sustainability Institute, the Global Resilience
Institute, the Barnett Institute for
Chemical and Biological Analysis, the Center for Drug Discovery, the Institute for Chemical Imaging of
Living Systems, the Network
Science Institute, the Northeastern
University Center for Renewable Energy Technology, an NSF Frontier Center in Theoretical
Biological Physics, and the Center for
Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems, providing a rich
multidisciplinary intellectual environment.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork. Hires will be mentored for success, with mentoring teams
and group guidance. In addition, a strong and effective faculty
development strategy is part of the Northeastern institutional
mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development office works in
conjunction with the Office of Research Development (ORD), the
Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion (OIDI), the Center
for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and
University Decision Support (UDS) to provide programs and trainings
to further develop and support a thriving faculty.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations. Opportunities to collaborate extend
beyond the University.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each

Possessing all the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the city of Bemidji — named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung (nicknamed Bemidji) — is home to a diverse population of more than 15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than 100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake, Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history. See BSU’s land acknowledgement statement here.

The AIRC works hard to support American Indian Students at BSU and connect them with local resources, people, and opportunities to enrich their professional and personal lives”, AIRC .
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban conveniences upon which college students rely.

As a nationally ranked program, The School of Occupational Therapy
recently celebrated its 75th anniversary and we believe that the
liberal arts emphasis at the university serves to enhance the study
of occupational therapy. Nurtured in a collaborative yet
academically rigorous environment, our students learn to think
critically and analytically, develop professional values and goals,
and become intellectually autonomous. Students benefit from
innovative project opportunities, comprehensive fieldwork
experiences, and a curriculum designed to develop professional
reasoning skills, build exceptional documentation skills, and
prepare them to exceed the minimum requirements for entry-level
practice.

Both the campus and the School of Occupational Therapy value
community partnerships and experiential learning. Occupational
therapy students participate in unique fieldwork I experiences
through community and onsite clinical experiences in mental health,
adult physical disabilities and pediatrics. Occupational therapy
faculty work as part of a supportive community and have the
advantage of working collaboratively both within the School of
Occupational Therapy as well as with other departments across
campus.

including the ability to apply for research funds, conference
participation support, and sabbaticals. Puget Sound is a member of

therapists. The program's research activities include human
locomotion, balance and posture, and health and wellness. In
addition, we have active collaborations with Athletic Training,
Mechanical Engineering, the Center of Health Equity Research,
Center for Bioengineering Innovation, and Biology. As a part of
their service, PT faculty can assist at a Dept. run pro bono
clinic.

Northern Arizona University has a student population of 29,569,

degrees.

COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement

As of 12/10/21, the Safer Federal Workforce employee vaccination
requirement is currently suspended pending the outcome of a federal
court-issued injunction. This injunction has suspended the recent
executive order issued by President Biden requiring all employees
of federal contractors to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. For
current status of the vaccine requirement and/or questions, please
visit FAQs for Employee Vaccination
Requirement.

Background Information

history verification and a degree verification (in some cases)

state of Arizona, NAU is required to participate in the federal
E-Verify program that assists employers with verifying new
employees' right to work in the United States. Finally, each year
Northern Arizona University releases an Annual Security Report. The report is a result
of a federal law known as the Clery Act. The report includes Clery
reportable crime statistics for the three most recent completed
calendar years and discloses procedures, practices and programs NAU
uses to keep students and employees safe including how to report
crimes or other emergencies occurring on campus. In addition, the
Fire Safety Report is combined with the Annual
Security Report for the NAU Flagstaff Mountain Campus as this
campus has on-campus student housing. This report discloses fire
safety policies and procedures related to on-campus student housing
and statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. If you

candidate statement on commitment to diversity
Diversity is a defining feature of California's past, present,
and future. Increasing the diversity of our educators to better
reflect the population of California is just one aspect of the
College of Education's dedication to just, equitable and inclusive
education. Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences,
values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and
circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender,
age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and
more.
All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an
integral component of curricular and pedagogical development to
enhance academic success. In this way, our students learn to value
and draw upon students' backgrounds not only to support them in
developing skills leading to success in the broader society, but
also as a mechanism to transform our schools and communities. We
believe that all faculty and staff who work for the College must
share these same commitments. Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php
to learn more about Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE).
The diversity statement should focus on your commitment to a
Just, Equitable and Inclusive Education. The diversity statement
will be assessed based on knowledge, experience, application, and
expertise as it relates to JEIE. The strongest statement will have
an emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.)
This statement can take several different forms and should
address at least one of the following:
Your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE.
How you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional
practices, your research and/or service activities.
How you have personally experienced JEIE.
Your experiences and/or qualifications that enhance your
ability to work with diverse students, faculty, parents, and
community stakeholders.

Finalists will be required to have three
letters of recommendation submitted. Please have these ready for
the referents to submit. On the References page of the online

state of Arizona, NAU is required to participate in the federal
E-Verify program that assists employers with verifying new
employees' right to work in the United States. Finally, each year
Northern Arizona University releases an Annual Security Report. The report is a result

campus has on-campus student housing. This report discloses fire
safety policies and procedures related to on-campus student housing
and statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. If you

year, though graduate teaching every year is not guaranteed. The

recommendation. Review of applications will begin on October 17,

Higher Education.

Social Justice: We are focused on removing
institutional barriers, taking responsibility for and mitigating
systemic barriers. We are invested in validating our students’

*EQUIVALENCY

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to

of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:

Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in Counseling""

qualifications. Do not assume that you do not need to submit a
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency because your degree is
similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

About the Department:

The Music Department at Cabrillo College is housed in state-of-the
art facilities and is the largest department within the Cabrillo
College Visual, Applied, and Performing Arts (VAPA) Division. Our
department is recognized as one of the finest community college
music departments in the state of California and the nation,
offering a comprehensive course of study for students to pursue
their musical goals and interests through rigorous coursework in
theory, ear-training, sight-singing, applied study, keyboard
skills, music technology and recording arts, and performance.

Three (3) two-year degrees and a Certificate of Achievement are
offered to prepare students for a successful audition and placement
into a university music program, and/or employment in the music
technology and recording arts industry:

An Associate in Arts in Music for Transfer (A.A.-T), which is
intended for students who plan to transfer and complete a
bachelor's degree in music at a CSU campus
A Model Associate Degree requiring 60 units appropriate to a
student's unique educational and transfer goals
A Music Technology and Recording Arts (MTRA) Associate in
Science Degree and Certificate of Achievement designed to prepare
students for a career in the music industry and/or transfer

The core instrumental ensemble experiences include concert band,
jazz band and combos (including Latin Jazz), orchestra, and
numerous chamber and multicultural ensembles, and are part of the
core transfer program and play prominently in each music major's
coursework each semester. These courses, especially the ensemble
courses, also provide enrichment for non-music majors and adults in
the community. The department will soon be adding a Mariachi/Band
ensemble course (Fall 2023), and hopes to explore the development
of a commercial music/studio ensemble to broaden the skills of
music majors toward greater employability in contemporary
professional ensembles, and bridge the gap between offerings in the
Music Department and the Music Technology and Recording Arts
Program.

of Social Work has students in Edinburg, Brownsville, Laredo, and
is exploring offering classes in Rio Grande City.

About UTRGV: It is UTRGV's Vision “To be one
of the nation's leaders in higher education, its premier
Hispanic-serving institution, and a highly engaged bilingual
university, with exceptional educational, research, and creative
opportunities that serve as catalysts for transformation in the Rio
Grande Valley and beyond.” As such, UTRGV is committed to
building a diverse faculty and staff that can contribute to an
enriching learning environment that strives for more equitable
outcomes for student success. UTRGV is a distributed campus, one
university spanning four counties and multiple locations. Our

About the School of Social Work The School of
Social Work was established in 2018 as an independent School and is
under the leadership of Founding Dean Dr. Luis R. Torres. The
Department of Social Work has existed since the 1970s, most
recently as part of the College of Health Professions. The
University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) School of Social Work
(SSW) is the only institution to offer programs leading to both the
Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree and the Master of Science in
Social Work (MSSW) degree south of San Antonio. Both programs are
accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). CSWE-COA
voted to reaffirm the accreditation of the program for eight years,
which extends through February 2023, and our reaffirmation process
is under way.

The BSW Program prepares students for generalist social work
practice. Building on the generalist foundation, the MSSW program
focuses on two concentrations: Direct Practice with Latino
Individuals, Families, and Groups; and Community Practice and
Administration. Its goals are to prepare graduates to practice with
diverse, vulnerable, and at-risk populations to promote human
well-being and social and economic justice, especially in the
Texas-Mexico border region; to prepare graduates for leadership in
developing and implementing policies and services for at-risk
populations with an emphasis on the Texas-Mexico border region; and
to develop the knowledge base of the social work profession,
particularly as it relates to addressing the needs of at-risk
populations with an emphasis on the Texas-Mexico border region. The
BSW program is in-person, and alternative modalities are being
explored. We offer all MSSW programs in two modalities, traditional
on-campus and online. A PhD in Social Work is under development, as
are a dual MSSW-MPH program. Other dual degree programs and MSSW
modalities have been approved by faculty and will be developed over
the next few years.

The School of Social Work is committed to preparing generalist and
advanced professional social workers to meet the needs of a
binational and multicultural community, and to increasingly make an
impact on the national stage. The Rio Grande Valley is a natural
laboratory for the demographic shifts being seen around the
country. The educational emphasis is on social work practice with
Hispanic/Latino/Latinx individuals and communities, and with other
diverse communities, considering multicultural competence, ethical
practice, knowledge building, and social services that promote
social and economic justice.

37383305,Professor and Director of the Annenberg Institute,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37383305/professor-and-director-of-the-annenberg-institute/,False,Brown University,"Providence, Rhode Island",Not specified,2022-12-22,"Brown University seeks to recruit an outstanding scholar of quantitative research in education policy and academic leader with a history of policy impact and partnerships. The successful candidate will join the faculty at the level of tenured Professor and serve as Director of the Annenberg Institute.

Background

The Annenberg Institute was founded in 1993 with generous support from the Annenberg Foundation.  Currently, the Institute’s endowment is valued at nearly $100 million. The Institute is supported by a combination of endowment income and grants. The mission of the Annenberg Institute is the pursuit of equitable, transformative education for just and flourishing societies. To achieve this mission, the Institute harnesses the power of Brown’s community to develop education leaders, build actionable knowledge, create tools for practice, partner with educators and policy-makers, and encourage robust civic discourse. It furthers this mission through the creation of public goods, including EdWorking Papers, EdInstruments, and EdResearch for Recovery, that provide ideas and tools to build actionable knowledge in policy and practice. The Institute also reaches beyond Brown to develop strong models of partnerships with local organizations connected to national-level policy reform.

The University’s strategic plan, Building on Distinction: A New Plan for Brown, calls for achieving distinction in “scholarship and public discourse on institutions and ideas that promote social justice and economic prosperity domestically and internationally.”  As Brown’s hub for education policy research broadly focused on questions of educational inequality, the Institute will stand alongside and partner with an array of highly-regarded academic units with related interests, including the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the School of Public Health, the Population Studies and Training Center, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, and the Data Science Initiative.
 
 
The Director Search

In seeking outstanding candidates to lead the Annenberg Institute in this phase of continued growth and development, the University will give greatest consideration to the following qualities and qualifications:
 
 
1. Academic Accomplishment. We seek a scholar with a demonstrated track record of quantitative research on education, particularly educational inequality, with impacts on education policy. They should have a strong scholarly record, including excellence in both research and teaching, appropriate for appointment at the level of full professor in a social science department at Brown. The Director must be able to evaluate academic scholarship from different disciplines, understand and embrace the standards of excellence expected in faculty recruitment and promotion processes, and be respected as a scholar within the broader Brown University faculty community.

2. Vision and Leadership. The new Director will work collaboratively with relevant faculty from across the University to determine the areas of continued investment and growth for the Annenberg Institute. The Director should be able to articulate how they will develop and adapt this strategy in the years ahead.
 
 
3. Public Engagement. The Director's record should demonstrate an appreciation of the important role of research in informing policy and practice. They should have experience engaging community stakeholders.

4. Administrative Experience/Leadership Style.  As the Annenberg Institute continues to develop, the next Director must be capable of leading an executive team to manage an increasingly complex organization with many different constituencies (faculty, staff, students, board, University administrators, donors, visitors, etc.). A demonstrated record of successful program development, faculty recruitment, and organizational management, and a leadership style that is both inclusive and directed, are key for this position. A track record of extramural support is essential; experience with a diversity of funding sources (state/federal, foundation, and other) is preferred.
 
 
To apply for this position, please use the following link: apply.interfolio.com/118908. Applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, names of three references (to be contacted at a later date). The cover letter should describe the candidate’s research, success supporting a diverse and inclusive academic environment, experience developing community partnerships, leadership experience, and vision for the Annenberg Institute.

We seek individuals with enthusiasm for undergraduate classroom and
laboratory teaching that incorporates evidence-based pedagogy and
inclusive and active learning techniques. The ideal candidate would
have teaching abilities in multiple areas to support a biomedical
engineering curriculum containing courses in bioinstrumentation,
signals and systems, biomechanics, materials, biostatistics,
computing, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and medical
device design. Individuals with a strong desire to develop
innovative student experiential learning activities and broaden
students' perspectives through curricular or co-curricular
activities are especially encouraged to apply. In addition,
candidates would be encouraged to intellectually engage with the
broader biomedical engineering education community at the local and
national level, e.g., attending ASEE and BMES conferences.
Financial support for professional development activities, such as

Applications must include a cover letter, a current C.V., and three
statements of no more than two pages each describing the
applicant's 1) evidence of a commitment to diversity and engaging
students in an inclusive classroom environment, 2) teaching
philosophy, experience relevant to the Bucknell biomedical
engineering curriculum, and identification of current required and
new elective courses they would be interested in teaching at
Bucknell, and 3) ideas for 2-3 innovations or pedagogies in
undergraduate BME education that they would be interested in
pursuing at Bucknell. Applicants should be prepared to provide
references upon request. Applications will only be accepted online
through Bucknell's career site (careers.bucknell.edu) and they will

The School of Integrated Sciences at James Madison University (JMU) invites applications for a full-time tenure-track colleague at the rank of assistant or associate professor. This person will join the Integrated Science and Technology Program (ISAT) in August 2023 to support the Energy concentration within the major. ISAT is a future-forward program that hopes to infuse a focus on more sustainable energy systems and technologies into our curriculum over time. With this goal in mind, we are seeking someone with expertise in energy fundamentals and a solid grasp on the challenges, opportunities, and technologies associated with the energy transition and decarbonization.
The ISAT Program was designed for and strives to be an inclusive community that removes barriers for historically marginalized and underrepresented individuals. We value the respectful exchange and exploration of ideas and emphasize the thoughtful development of alternative perspectives on current problems, future challenges, and problem-solving. We believe that mutual respect and the free exploration of ideas promote the diverse environment that is essential to fulfilling our educational and professional mission. We welcome colleagues who can join us in support of these values.
ISAT’s novel curricular framework makes for an exciting, supportive, and interdisciplinary academic culture, enabling faculty and students from a variety of backgrounds to grow into new areas of expertise. Faculty come together around a shared passion for impactful and socially-engaged STEM education and scholarship.
ISAT is an ABET-accredited, multidisciplinary, applied science undergraduate degree program with roughly 300 majors. We emphasize a holistic approach to define and address complex problems using science, technology, and social systems. Students declare a concentration in one of six areas: Energy, Applied Biotechnology, Applied Computing, Environment and Sustainability, Industrial and Manufacturing Systems, and Public Interest Technology & Science.
Industry connections enrich and inform the educational experiences we provide. The majority of our students participate in internships or other partnerships with local industries. As a result, graduates enjoy meaningful and agile careers in public and provide sectors. Some pursue advanced degrees in a wide variety of fields. Energy education is also a priority in Virginia. We are one of few states in the U.S. with K-12 standards of learning (SOLs) focused on energy education, and also offer a Career Cluster curriculum for energy-specific career technical education (CTE) in public schools.
In addition to the ISAT program, the School of Integrated Sciences is home to undergraduate degrees in Intelligence Analysis and Geography, offering rich opportunities to collaborate across these globally-minded programs. ISAT’s Master’s Degree in Environmental Management and Sustainability may provide opportunities to teach at the Master’s level.
Duties and Responsibilities:
Our new colleague will teach a variety of energy lecture and laboratory courses in ISAT. Meaningful teaching opportunities also exist in STEM foundation courses, where students build upon existing quantitative skills in preparation for more advanced coursework. Curricular design and development are supported and encouraged. A typical teaching load is three courses per semester.
In addition to excellence in undergraduate teaching, the position requires an active scholarly program (research and/or application) that enriches and engages faculty and students in one or more of ISAT’s concentration areas (See “General Information”). For example, ISAT faculty work with undergraduates on multi-year capstone projects. These projects provide opportunities for diverse teams of students and faculty to explore, develop, and expand scholarly interests. Excellence in scholarship involves active participation in and contribution to one or more external scholarly communities.
All faculty participate in service activities to support the school, college, and university; working together is encouraged and recognized within our reward structure. Community engagement—including authentic K-12, government, and industry partnerships—is highly encouraged.
Qualifications:
Our new colleague will have expertise in the fundamentals of energy science, engineering, and technologies, including energy efficiency and conservation. We are particularly interested in individuals who specialize in one or more of the following areas: renewable energy; the electric power sector; building energy systems and management; verification, monitoring, and control of energy systems; electrification of transportation; energy security; or energy modeling (e.g., dynamic systems, data mining).
At least one of the candidate’s degrees must be in a STEM area. A terminal degree in a relevant discipline and demonstrated technical expertise is required for a tenure-track appointment; ABD candidates are encouraged to apply. Candidates with a Master’s degree and substantial experience in the field are welcomed and would be eligible for a full-time renewable term appointment. Experience working in the energy sector would be a plus.
Our new colleague will embrace the interdisciplinary culture of our work by actively seeking opportunities to develop their expertise by collaborating across program and/or curriculum boundaries. Candidates must demonstrate a strong potential for teaching undergraduates, an ability to contribute to the ISAT energy concentration now and in the future, and a commitment to scholarship involving students.
Inclusivity and interconnectedness are inherent to the ISAT Program. Strong candidates will demonstrate a commitment to collegiality, equity, and inclusivity. These qualities support ISAT and University goals of integrating diverse perspectives, fostering inclusive learning environments, and enabling all students to flourish.

Department Summary

The only comprehensive accredited journalism program in the Pacific
Northwest, the School of Journalism and Communication (SOJC) offers
majors in advertising, journalism, media studies, and public
relations; Honors Program; media studies and science communication
minors; and supports the University of Oregon's interdisciplinary
Cinema Studies major and Multimedia and Native American Studies
minors. The school offers Ph.D. and M.A. degrees in Media Studies
and professional master's degrees in Journalism, Multimedia
Journalism, Immersive Media Communication, and Strategic
Communication. The school supports an innovative undergraduate
curriculum in state-of-the-art facilities both in Eugene and
Portland. Across our programs, we are committed to creating a
diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning and work environment.
With more than 2,200 students, SOJC is one of six professional
schools at UO. The UO is a Research I member of the American
Association of Universities.
Position Summary

The School of Journalism and Communication at the University of
Oregon seeks a professor of practice to join our thriving
Eugene-based undergraduate public relations program. The professor
of practice is a position designed for eminently qualified
professionals, who may not have a traditional academic background,
and who have accumulated significant professional
experience—including senior management level work— and
accomplishments in the field of public relations and communication
management, fully congruent with the rank of professor. The ideal
candidate will (1) be able to speak to current trends in areas such
as food and beverage, travel, or internal/employee communication,
or (2) complement one of our established areas of expertise: social
media strategy; sports public relations; science, risk
environmental and/or health communication; diversity, equity,
inclusion, and access; or technology including immersive media. A
professor of practice's main responsibilities are instruction
(60%), professional development and serving as a liaison between
the industry and the SOJC programs (20%), and service to the
undergraduate public relations program (20%). The ideal candidate
will be able to teach across the public relations and strategic
communication curriculum and the expected teaching load is six
courses per year.

The successful candidate will have the potential to contribute to
our professional master's programs, including our Master's in
Strategic Communication, Master's in Advertising and Brand
Responsibility, and our new Master's in Immersive Media
Communication. The person selected for this position will also have
the opportunity to be considered for the Director of the Master's
in Strategic Communication program, dependent on qualifications.
Ultimately, we seek someone who will help build our undergraduate
program, work collaboratively with our faculty and students at the
undergraduate and graduate levels, help keep our curriculum
innovative, and collaborate across the school and majors. An
advanced degree is preferred.

Beyond our curriculum, the public relations program emphasizes
professional development for our approximately 450 undergraduate
students. The professor of practice will leverage their industry
experience and serve as a liaison between the professional field
and our students by designing professional site visits,
interviewing, and networking workshops, and portfolio development
opportunities. As service accounts for 20% of this position, the
ideal candidate would be enthusiastic about mentoring undergraduate
students through our professional organizations, such as our Public
Relations Student Society of America's chapter (PRSSA) and Allen
Hall PR (student-run agency). The successful candidate, therefore,
will also be someone who can contribute to this important aspect of
the program, help mentor students in their professional journey and
participate more broadly in professionally focused opportunities
across the school.

We invite applications from qualified candidates who share our
commitment to a diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning and work
environment.

circumstances, significant professional experience may substitute
