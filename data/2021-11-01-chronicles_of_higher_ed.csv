UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the
city of Bemidji — named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung
(nicknamed Bemidji) — is home to a diverse population of more than
15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than
100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

The Department of Prevention and Community
Health works to understand multilevel drivers of health
inequities and the role of social justice in the
public’s health. Through academic training, research and practice,
we use theory and innovative mixed methods to investigate and
promote community health. Our faculty of social and behavioral
scientists working in public health reflects multiple disciplines
including psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, data
scientists, and experts in health education, communication and
behavior change. Our community-engaged research and
intervention approaches range from those focused on developing

digital health approaches to those focused on structural-level
changes and broader societal transformation using community
mobilization, policy and advocacy.

Artificial Intelligence (https://t.uga.edu/7hW). Rather than
being housed exclusively in a single department, however, the
majority of UGA’s newly recruited faculty will focus on the fusion
of data science and AI in cross-cutting areas such as infectious
diseases, integrative precision agriculture, ethics, cybersecurity,
resilient communities and the environment.
 
The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to
demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensure
that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity in
our college. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of
the university and college,
and this hiring initiative will make use of the
best practices to ensure an inclusive search process.
The Diversity
and Inclusion Plan for the
college identifies priority areas for our investments and
through the 2021-2022 academic year we will develop a Diversity
Strategic Plan as part of a campus-wide effort. The college
offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support
professional development. Several programs exist to
enhance the inclusiveness of our college, including a student-led
Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that
promotes discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and
inclusion. 
 
UGA seeks to expand research at the cutting edge of infectious
disease science, and to build scientific capacity for pandemic
prevention and preparedness. This cluster hire is aimed at
developing an integrated basic and translational scientific
paradigm for understanding epidemics. This Infectious Disease
Cluster will strengthen and expand UGA’s position as a global
leader in infectious disease dynamics. Recognized globally for its
contributions to systems engineering, disease ecology,
epidemiology, and evolution, UGA is seeking to build on its
existing core strengths in modeling pathogen spillover,
transmission, intervention, and spatial spread by expanding its
capabilities in epidemic forecasting, biosurveillance, applications
of artificial intelligence to infectious disease research, and
nonparametric, agent-based, and multi-scale modeling of disease
transmission.
 
The faculty positions are distributed over the following four
schools or colleges: Department
of Statistics, Franklin College of Arts and Sciences,
Odum School of
Ecology, School of Chemical,
Materials and Biomedical Engineering, College of
Engineering, 
Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, College of Public
Health. To facilitate interaction among these
researchers, each faculty member will have membership in the
Center for the Ecology of
Infectious Diseases (CEID) and/or the Institute of Bioinformatics
(IOB). Collectively, these new faculty members will help
position UGA to contribute to anticipated national networks of
centers for molecular epidemiology, predictive intelligence for
infectious diseases, and infectious disease forecasting, modeling,
and analytics. For more information on the cluster hiring
initiative and all the five currently open positions for this year,
visit ceid.uga.edu/idd.
 
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join
a rapidly growing engineering college that combines
interdisciplinary research and scholarship with excellent
instruction and service. The UGA College of Engineering
currently enrolls over 2,500 engineering majors and has over 80
full-time faculty
across fifteen-degree programs.  Significant
investments in infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of
laboratory facilities for research and scholarship and new
classrooms and instructional labs. College of Engineering
faculty will have space in two major capital projects on campus to
create interdisciplinary research facilities. Our main
instructional facility has also
undergone complete renovation to create flexible
classrooms that enable a range of teaching modalities and the
incorporation of interdisciplinary instructional labs. The
common instructional facilities also foster diversity since they
allow faculty, staff, and students to interact and collaborate
in a single facility.  
 
Minimum Qualifications
Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering, Bioengineering, or a related
discipline.
 
Relevant/Preferred Qualifications

A strong record of research, scholarship, and instruction that
is commensurate with the stage in their professional career and

Augsburg's Statement of Commitment on
Equity
We believe that education is the key to healthy, meaningful and
productive lives for individuals, as well as to the vibrancy of our
democracy. Augsburg University is dedicated to achieving an
educational experience free from the barriers of poverty, racism,
and discrimination so that students can fully realize their unique
gifts. Recognizing that higher education's democratic promise is

and completion, Augsburg is called to stand for equity in
everything we do to fulfill our academic mission, serve our
students and engage our fellow citizens.
 
Our Students
Augsburg University has approximately 2,000 traditional
undergraduate students, 500 adult undergraduate students and 1,000
graduate students. The University's commitment to intentional
diversity is reflected in the student body: For the past two years,
students of color represented 40-50 % of the incoming first-year
undergraduate class. Augsburg's commitment to an intentionally
diverse community goes beyond race and ethnicity and includes
programs for first-generation students; non-traditional-age
students; students from a broad array of faith backgrounds,
cultures and nationalities; students of various gender and sexual
orientation identities; students in recovery; and students with
disabilities.

education is defined by excellence in the liberal arts and
professional studies, guided by the faith and values of the
Lutheran church, and shaped by its urban and global settings. At
both undergraduate and graduate levels, students actively engage in
international travel and intercultural experiences that broaden
their view of the world and deepen their engagement in it.
 
Augsburg University values the diversity of persons,
perspectives, and convictions. Critical thinking, rigorous

the heart of the University's mission as an institution of higher
learning. Essential to the University in living out its mission of

Invites nominations and
applications for the inaugural
 
EL-HIBRI ENDOWED CHAIR and
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Interfaith@Augsburg
An Institute to Promote
Interfaith Learning and Leadership
 
Augsburg University seeks a nationally and internationally
recognized leader in interfaith learning and leadership to be the
inaugural El-Hibri Endowed Chair and Executive Director,
Interfaith@Augsburg.
 
This endowed position aims to promote a commitment to interfaith
leadership that includes knowledge of the world’s religious and
humanist traditions, skills in interreligious competence and
communication, and sensibilities such as curiosity, humility and
civility.
 
The University seeks a creative and visionary leader who will
steward interfaith initiatives of an institution that is guided by
""the faith and values of the Lutheran church"" and committed to
educating students to be ""informed citizens, thoughtful stewards,
critical thinkers, and responsible leaders."" In this context,
Augsburg is deeply committed to enhancing interfaith leadership on
campus and nationally. Importantly, this commitment to interfaith
leadership is a priority in Augsburg’s current strategic plan. In
addition, the Chair and Executive Director will advance the
university-wide priorities of social justice, diversity, equity,
and inclusion through teaching, research, speaking, and
service.  Finally, positioned within the university’s Division
of Mission and Identity, the El-Hibri Chair and Executive Director
will engage interfaith communities locally, nationally, and
internationally.  
 
Interfaith engagement is a core aspect of Augsburg’s academic
mission and reflects the religious and secular diversity of our
campus and surrounding community. Augsburg has committed itself to
the belief that religious diversity can be a constructive force
serving the common good. To help further that belief, we have
established Interfaith@Augsburg: An Institute to Promote
Interfaith Learning and Leadership. The Institute’s early
work, under the leadership of the Rev. Mark Hanson, illustrates the
many ways in which our commitment to interfaith learning and
leadership can shape our work on campus and in the wider community.
The El-Hibri Chair and Executive Director will lead a strategic
planning process that strengthens, integrates, and extends the
institute’s work on campus and beyond.
 
The El-Hibri Endowed Chair and Executive Director will have a
terminal degree in an appropriate academic discipline and will have
extensive experience in administrative leadership, teaching
excellence, and scholarly work. We anticipate that the El-Hibri
Chair will be a person grounded in a non-Christian faith or
spiritual tradition.
 
Responsibilities
In addition to meeting the general qualifications outlined
above, the Chair has more specific responsibilities that will
include: 

Provide executive leadership for Interfaith@Augsburg,
including strategic planning, staff supervision, budget management,
and program oversight.


Steward the conversation about the importance of interfaith
learning and leadership within the university among faculty,
students, administrators, and staff, with an emphasis on the
intersectionality of religious pluralism and social issues such as
racial justice, health care, and science
Develop resources and convene conversations concerning
interfaith leadership for businesses, community and religious
organizations, and other academic programs and institutions
Be of counsel to the President, Vice Presidents, and
Regents
Pursue excellence in scholarship, teaching, speaking, and
service within the university and beyond
Function as a thought-leader among faculty and staff
Teach as appropriate, as well as direct the Interfaith
Scholars' Seminar, a year-long seminar on interfaith dialogue and
action involving ten upper-division undergraduates from across the
university
Work in collaboration with other leaders of the Division for
Mission and Identity to advance the university's mission with the
faculty, staff, and students
In collaboration with colleagues in the Division for Mission
and Identity and the Vice President for Inclusion, work across the
university's Centers of Commitment to advance institutional
commitments to justice, inclusion, equity, and diversity
Work with faculty colleagues to develop curricular resources
concerning interfaith leadership for degree and credential programs
across the university
Plan public programs that extend interfaith learning,
understanding, and relationships

 
Support
The El-Hibri Chair and Executive Director will include
competitive salary commensurate with credentials and
experience.  Rank and tenure are open and negotiable.  An
operational fund supports the Chair and Executive Director’s
scholarship and travel, including presenting at academic
conferences and representing the university at meetings,
conferences, and consultations.  While the El-Hibri Chair and
Executive Director is a university-wide position, its holder will
also have a departmental “home” appropriate to academic interest.
The El-Hibri Chair and Executive Director reports directly to the
President.

The university is a residential urban institution of 3500
students located near downtown Minneapolis, with ready access to
the enormous range of cultural and artistic events for which the

signature Centers of Commitment:  the Christensen Center for
Vocation, the Center for Global Education, the Sabo Center for

approximately 1,000 students living on campus, Augsburg engages
students in a wide range of co-curricular activities, including
NCAA Division III intercollegiate athletics. At both undergraduate

tenure-track faculty position in photography at the rank of
Assistant Professor with a start date of July 1, 2022.
The position is a full time, nine-month academic year
appointment.

We seek candidates whose creative practices are rooted in
contemporary art and interdisciplinarity. We broadly
invite applicants who take up a lens-based approach as foundational
to their practice, some examples being:
installation-related approach to the medium, drawing from
photography’s status as an indexical trace of the visible
world; documentary approach to the image that expands and disrupts
historical uses of the genre; or a lens-based
approach that engages the performative aspects of the medium.
Applicants should be skilled in both traditional
analog photography methods and digital technologies, as well as
have a fluency in contemporary cultural and
aesthetic discourses.

The Department of Art and Art History at UNC-Chapel Hill is
dedicated to building a diverse community of faculty
who are committed to anti-racism, equity, and inclusion. Therefore,
we seek a colleague who is engaged with
central issues around racism, gender discrimination, and all forms
of intolerance in their practice and / or in their
teaching, contributing to the diversity of the department by
bringing a perspective and / or a unique set of
experiences that deepen the intellectual conversations in the field
of photography.

The Department of Art and Art History seeks a colleague who will
participate in shaping the future of photography
at the University. The successful candidate will have a dynamic
studio practice, and will have the ability to teach a
range of undergraduate courses; to mentor graduate students working
across disciplines; and to work effectively
with faculty, staff, and students from diverse backgrounds. Central
teaching responsibilities will be in the area of
photography, with additional opportunities to teach
interdisciplinary courses such as first year seminars,
graduate
seminars and experimental courses. The teaching load is two courses
per semester, and all studio faculty serve
on 2-3 MFA graduate committees per year. Service responsibilities
include departmental committee contributions,
advising, and participation in shared governance. In addition to
teaching and service responsibilities, the
successful candidate will be expected to demonstrate a commitment
to a sustained and developing creative
practice, with an active and ongoing exhibition and publishing
record.

SCA Theatre-Performance
At the School for the Contemporary Arts (SCA) we study
performance as a worldmaking art practice; as a frame for
encountering the past, present, and future; and as open questions
we ask through rigorous studio experimentation: What can
performance do? Why make performance now? What new forms can
performance take within a contemporary context? What is the future
of live performance? At SCA, we empower students to collaborate
across disciplines, become versatile artists, and expand the field
of live performance. In the Theatre-Performance BFA track, students
explore a broad range of genres and forms including devised
theatre, live art, and social practice. Our program deviates from
traditional theatre training by experimenting with contemporary
processes of performance, unconventional narrative styles, expanded
dramaturgy, experimental forms, new media and creative research. We
examine how the fundamentals of performance—time, space, body,
text, movement—help us stage our burning political questions, enact
necessary social interventions, and advance the broad aesthetic
fields of contemporary art.
We seek a colleague to expand the pedagogic aim and scope of our
program by supporting performance practices and research beyond
traditional theatre training. Our emergent studio and hybrid
studio-seminar courses serve six core-curricular groupings in the

University Background:
The mission of California Lutheran University is to educate leaders

and justice. Founded in 1959 in beautiful Ventura County, the
university has an enrollment of about 4,000 undergraduate and
graduate students who come from across the nation and around the
world from a diversity of backgrounds, cultures and faiths. As a
federally recognized Hispanic-Serving Institution, Cal Lutheran is
looking for candidates with a dedication to and success in working
in diverse communities. The university is committed to an inclusive
learning and work environment that values individual differences
and respects each person’s dignity.

Basic Function:

Emphasis) beginning in August 2022.

program that can involve graduate students, AAMFT Approved
Supervisor status or eligibility with willingness to obtain the
credential, and a California Marriage and Family Therapy license or
license eligibility. Preference will be given to applicants from a
COAMFTE accredited doctoral program in Marriage and Family Therapy
and experience with the COAMFTE accreditation process. The

students from underrepresented backgrounds will be particularly
competitive.

School comprised of Master of Science programs in Counseling
Psychology (MFT emphasis) and Clinical Psychology, an
APA-accredited PsyD program in Clinical Psychology, and two large

faculty interested in research with clinical populations, the
clinics provide individual, couples, family, group, and child
services to community members with mild to moderate mental health
issues and currently offer specialized programs in intimate partner
violence, dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and
commitment therapy. The Centers also provide practicum
opportunities for MFT and PsyD students who are supervised by a
Clinic Director, Assistant Director, and 8 licensed clinical
supervisors. MFT students can complete required supervised hours in
the Center or supplement their training with other externships in
the community.

The School distinguishes itself by having small classes, a caring
faculty and staff, state of the art facilities and technology, and
a rigorous curriculum that is being aligned with COAMFTE standards.
The MFT program is designed to train students with a focus on
Marriage and Family Therapy systemic theory and application,

missing and murdered Indigenous women– a local and national
epidemic which can be traced back to the arrival of European
colonizers across Turtle Island. We acknowledge and fight against
the legacy of white supremacy and culture of anti-Black racism in
our own community, which has led to the murders of Jamar Clark,
Philando Castile, George Floyd, Daunte Wright, Winston Smith, and
countless other Black Americans across this nation. Black lives
matter. We stand with our Hmong, Asian, Asian-American, and Pacific
Islander communities against the rise of xenophobic violence since
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that words are not
enough and we remain committed to the work of eradicating the
injustices against all Black, Indigenous, and people of color
caused by systemic racism.

the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto;
Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and
Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through
this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-disciplinary majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

The Bouve College of Health Sciences has over 200 faculty members
across four schools (Community Health and Behavioral Sciences,
Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Clinical and
Rehabilitation Sciences), with approximately 2,000 undergraduate
and 2,400 graduate students. It is the leading national model for
education and research in the health, psychosocial, and biomedical
sciences and supports the University's mission of educating

About the College/Department:
Eastern Kentucky University is a regional, coeducational, public
institution of higher education offering general and liberal arts
programs, pre-professional and professional training in education
and various other fields at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels. Located in Richmond, Madison County, Kentucky, EKU has a

to the Commonwealth. Eastern Kentucky University is committed to
access, equal opportunity, dignity, respect, and inclusion for all

parts of Kentucky and surrounding states. Richmond is 26 miles
southeast of Lexington, Kentucky. Interstate Highways I-75

Cincinnati, 112 miles to the north, and Louisville, 110 miles to
the west, within convenient distance by automobile. Richmond is
also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and
Kentucky Route 52 from the east and west. The Bluegrass, Mountain,
Daniel Boone, and Cumberland Parkways provide even greater
accessibility by automobile since the city is located near the
convergence of these arterial highways into the interstate
system.

EKU is a dedicated high-quality instruction, scholarship, and
service, and places emphasis on the three in that order. Through
its colleges and schools, the University seeks to offer quality
instruction at a variety of degree levels in general education, the
arts, the sciences, business, education, pre-professional and
professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through
consultative services, continuing education, and the extended
campus, the University seeks to provide service to the community
and the region. Research seeks both to advance knowledge in the
subject matter areas with which the University is concerned and to
support the primary function of teaching.

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

The Department of Mathematics is one of nine departments within the
College of Natural Sciences at CSUSB. We offer four bachelor
degrees and a masters degree, as well as a minor in mathematics, a
Certificate in Introductory Actuarial Mathematics, and a Subject
Matter Authorization.

Our CSUSB mathematical community is known for being warm,
welcoming, and supportive. Our classes are relatively small,
especially at the upper division level. This helps promote great
interaction between students and instructors and helps develop a
strong sense of community. Most of our students are the first in
their families to go to college. The majority of our students are
from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines.
CSUSB is nationally recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution
(HSI) and we are one of the top mathematics departments in
graduating Hispanic students.

The Design programs at UT are flourishing, as demand for design is
exploding on our campus and in our city. As we grow, we are seeking

Specifically, we seek a leader who will deepen our commitment to
ensure that design serves—and is practiced by—people of diverse
races, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and abilities.

Our program is developing in several areas of design. This search
would be well satisfied by an expert in interaction, graphic, or
industrial design, or related sub-disciplines such as design
ethnography, or in design pedagogy. This leader's expertise will
inform the direction of the program, and we are authentically open
to being influenced in this way.

The Design Department at UT is very uniquely situated.

First, we are in Austin, TX, a booming creative and technology
hub with endless possibilities for industry collaborations and
employment opportunities for students and graduates.
We take advantage of our position inside a top-tier research
institution by partnering with other departments and centers of
excellence on campus, including existing partnerships with the Dell
Medical School, the College of Engineering, Texas Robotics and
others - and, our tenure-track researchers enjoy the support of an
institution committed to the highest caliber of research and
creative practice.
We are proud to be a part of the College of Fine Arts, lending
us a genuine commitment to craftsmanship and aesthetics.
At the same time, our largest enrollment program - via The
Center for Integrated Design - welcomes students from any
discipline to explore the places where Design Thinking might
overlap with their major of choice.


Our new colleague will ideally appreciate the breadth and depth of
our program and the unique circumstances for design in higher
education that we currently represent.

About the Department of Design

The design program at UT, formerly a division of the Department of

combined forces with the Department of Arts and Entertainment
Technologies, the Center for Integrated Design, and the Design
Institute for Health to form the new School of Design and Creative
Technologies (SDCT). The move to SDCT has enabled the design
program to expand its enrollment and course offerings to meet
growing demand from majors and non-majors and to develop industry
partnerships. The department now offers two undergraduate degrees
and two graduate degrees, as well as extensive additional
coursework geared toward students majoring elsewhere on campus who
wish to be more designerly in their approach to their work.

2020, with the generous support of the John L. Nau Foundation and
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the University of Virginia’s
Democracy Initiative and College of Arts & Sciences launched a
multiyear faculty hiring project. Over four years, we will hire a
dozen or more new faculty members at all ranks in the departments
of Classics, History, and Philosophy, Politics, and elsewhere.
Across all the searches, the Departments seek to appoint scholars
whose primary research is focused on the study of the principles of
democracy, democratic accountability, and representation, either to
advance the work of the core lab on the history and principles of
democracy or to contribute to one of the Initiative’s other
projects.
 
This year, the Corcoran Department of History at the
University of Virginia seeks a historian of Africa before 1900 at
the assistant professor level. The successful candidate will be
appointed to a tenure-track position in the Department of History
and will be affiliated with the Democracy Initiative.
 
We invite applications from scholars of Africa whose
research addresses themes of authority, community, and power,
broadly defined. We are particularly interested in scholars who can
contribute to non-teleological and critical debates about the
global history of governance and political participation through
African history. Possible specializations include: political
thought; precolonial states and societies; economic life and
material culture; environment and ecologies; religion and belief
systems; forms of knowledge and technologies; and visual culture,
art, and music. Novel methodologies and cross-disciplinary
approaches are welcome.
 
We welcome scholars whose work is centered in the
field of African history with potential connections to the
Atlantic, Mediterranean, or Indian Ocean worlds. Regional
specialization within Africa is open. Scholars outside the U.S.
academy and current graduate students are especially encouraged to
apply. Applicants must have successfully defended their
dissertation by August 25, 2022.
 
The mission of the Democracy Initiative is to promote
excellence in research, teaching, and public engagement on
democracy at a global scale by bringing together a diverse range of
scholars, government leaders, and practitioners to study and
advance the prospects of democracy around the world. The Democracy
Initiative is interdisciplinary and supports and advances the work
of faculty, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, in the
humanities, the arts, and the social sciences. To that end, the
Initiative supports a variety of labs built on models of
collaborative work. The Democracy Labs consist of a series of
three-year, rotating labs on various topics, connected by the work
of the John Nau III History and Principles of Democracy Lab (the
Nau Core Lab), an interdisciplinary hub of research, teaching, and
outreach. Current labs are focused on corruption and the rule of
law, democracy and new media, democratic statecraft, the links
between environmental and racial inequality, and race, religion,
and democracy. The Democracy Initiative also supports two projects
focused on community engagement and research, the Memory Project,
and The Equity Center. In addition to holding appointments in their
home departments, each new faculty member hired under this
initiative will also be a member either of the Nau Core lab or one
of the Initiative’s other research labs or projects.
 
Review of applications will begin, November 8, 2021
and the position will remain open until filled.   The
appointment begins with the Fall 2022 semester.

Mental Health
Santa Clara University’s Department of Counseling Psychology in
the School of Education and Counseling Psychology seeks to make a
tenured appointment for the Sherri Sobrato Brisson Endowed
Professor of Child and Adolescent Mental Health to lead the
development of a new specialization in Child and Adolescent Mental
Health, and engage in research and a wide range of outreach and
thought leadership activities in this area to raise awareness and
understanding of the mental health needs and issues facing children
and adolescents. This appointment will ideally begin by summer or
fall of 2022.
The vision of our School is “A world in which everyone receives
the education and the psychological tools and support needed to
live flourishing lives of meaning, purpose and connection.” The
Counseling Psychology department supports this mission by preparing
highly-skilled therapists and related professionals to enact this
work. As one of the nation’s premier master’s programs for licensed
therapists, the Department of Counseling Psychology prepares
professionals in transformative therapeutic perspectives and
methods to improve the most vulnerable lives, with a particular
focus on educating clinicians and related professionals who will
advance mental health and well-being for and with our racially,
ethnically, linguistically and economically diverse communities.
Our students and graduates work in schools, hospitals, clinics and
other settings with individuals and families. Our program is
well-known for its integrative approaches to clinical work, and its
focus on theory, practice, and the person of the therapist. We
recognize the tremendous need for well-prepared therapists to serve
the large and growing needs for mental health care among children
and adolescents.
Our program currently offers students four optional areas of
emphasis (similar to a minor): Alternative and Correctional
Counseling, Health Psychology, Latinx Counseling, and LGBTQ+
Counseling. We seek someone who will guide the development and
growth of a unique Child and Adolescent Mental Health
Specialization for students pursuing work with children,
adolescents and families.  We see this specialization as a
“super-concentration” that will entail coursework designed to
prepare those whose aim is to work with children and families.
Students might also combine this Child and Adolescent Mental Health
Specialization with one of the concentrations named above to deepen
their engagement with specialized populations.
The candidate will also use this endowed professorship and funds
attached to this endowment as a platform to engage in scholarship,
public outreach, and advocacy for the mental health needs of
children and adolescents. This is an ideal position for someone who
seeks to combine the teaching and support of new therapists with an
active program of research and opportunities to
provide and guide public outreach both regionally and nationally.
With this Endowed Chair, Santa Clara’s Counseling Psychology
Department is making a commitment to pursue pioneering scholarship
and practice related to the complex task of preparing clinicians
for their work with children, adolescents and their families, and
Santa Clara University is making a statement that the mental health
of children and adolescents is a core value and needs far more
attention than it currently receives.
For this endowed professorship, we seek an accomplished, senior
faculty member (most likely at the Full Professor level, but
Associate Professors are also encouraged to apply) with a strong
vision for expanding access to quality mental health care for
children and adolescents. The specific area of focus within child
and adolescent mental health is open, although applicants whose
work focuses on the needs of BIPOC communities in the mental health
care of children and adolescents are particularly welcome. We
expect the individual to bring a broad appreciation of the needs of
children for different treatment modalities (e.g., play and
expressive arts therapies, trauma-focused clinical applications,
symptom-focused approaches) in diverse settings, and across a wide
range of mental health concerns. We also expect that this endowed
professor will serve as a strong voice for the mental health needs
of children and adolescents in our community and beyond, and will
lead public events and trainings to engage therapists in the region
and the wider public in conversations about child and adolescent
mental health.
The ideal candidate for this endowed professorship will have an
active portfolio of research, demonstrated leadership in the field,
and a willingness to work collaboratively and lead both within and
across research areas. A track record of success in seeking
extramural funding for research and other activities is highly
desirable, as is a history of clinical work. The candidate will be
an individual who can bring vision and leadership to the Department
of Counseling Psychology, to mentor junior faculty and students, to
build an innovative program of scholarship, clinical training, and
public outreach to enable thriving, flourishing children and
adolescents.
Santa Clara University has made the commitment to engage in the
work needed to become an anti-racist university. As a Department,
we are keenly aware that the mental health needs of children and
adolescents within communities of color are sometimes less
well-served than those in other communities. The candidate must
exhibit an understanding of the causes and consequences of the
effects of race and inequality on children, youth,
families, and communities. Competitive applicants will be
knowledgeable about the impact of these factors on quality of life
issues, such as health disparities, trauma and mental health,
interpersonal violence, education, and employment. Candidates whose
commitment to child and adolescent mental health include a
particular focus on underserved communities are strongly encouraged
to apply.  
Qualifications
Candidates must possess a Ph.D. in Clinical or Counseling
Psychology, or other degree (e.g., MD) that prepares an individual
for clinical work. Candidates must have extensive clinical
experience with children and adolescents, and be eligible for
licensure in the State of CA. In addition, candidates must possess
an active portfolio of scholarship and teaching, including a
demonstrated capacity for obtaining external funding.
Application Instructions
Applications should be submitted through the SCU application
portal [here],
and will include a current CV and cover letter. Cover letters
should detail the candidate’s interest in the position, including
information about their experience, interests, and/or commitment
to: Clinical work with children and families, a research agenda in
child and adolescent mental health, public outreach and engagement,
and engagement with issues of diversity, equity and inclusion – in
teaching, research, and clinical work. Reference checks will be
completed with finalists. Application review will begin
on January 1, 2022; while applications will be taken
until the position is filled, candidates are encouraged to apply as
early as possible for the fullest consideration. Direct all
inquiries regarding this position to Sabrina Zirkel, Dean, Santa
Clara University School of Education and Counseling Psychology

UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the
city of Bemidji — named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung
(nicknamed Bemidji) — is home to a diverse population of more than
15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than
100,000.
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.
The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for
engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining
restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji.
The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows;
restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the
First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits;
and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon
Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The
Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.
For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use
trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with
walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State
Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across
the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area — just 12
miles north of campus — offers downhill skiing and
BSU-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further,
the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from
Bemidji.

We seek a scholar with a research and teaching program that merges
humanities-based inquiry with innovative forms of public
engagement, reaching audiences both within and outside academia. As
a member of the interdisciplinary adult bachelor’s program, this
hire will advance the mission of SPE through pedagogy
that encourages students to be civically engaged actors and
prepares them for community-based, creative, and /or applied work
beyond the classroom. While we will consider scholars from a wide
range of disciplines within the humanities, we have a particular
interest in candidates whose research engages interdisciplinary
fields and who have degrees from programs such as American Studies,
Critical Race and Ethnicity Studies, Cultural Studies, Performance
Studies, Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Environmental
Studies. The ideal candidate will have a demonstrated record of
social justice advocacy. Preference will also be given to

Directed Learning, students reflect on their experiences outside
the classroom and execute projects under the guidance of our
faculty. Many of our students work full time and are returning to
school having  pursued careers in a wide variety of fields. As
such, they represent a highly self-motivated student body with
diverse work experiences and backgrounds. 

As part of the Schools of Public Engagement at The New School, the
Bachelor’s Program for Adults and Transfer Students values
traditional modes of scholarship (e.g., peer reviewed journal
articles and books directed at scholarly or general audiences) and
creative practice in different media (e.g., films, performance, art
exhibitions, and other curatorial projects). Ideal candidates for
this position would complement the faculty through public facing
scholarship and practice.

The New School, a private university in New York City’s Greenwich
Village, serves undergraduate and graduate students across a range
of fields with a commitment to bringing practices in design and
social research to studying issues of our time and challenging
students to become engaged citizens dedicated to solving programs
and contributing to the public good.   The New School is
committed to actively recruiting applicants from a diverse pool and
we encourage candidates from groups underrepresented in US higher
education to apply. We recognize systemic barriers to higher
education and employment and we aim to reduce barriers to careers
in higher education through our required and preferred
qualifications.  We specifically invite applicants from
communities who have been and continue to be marginalized from the
humanities and liberal arts more broadly. The New
School is committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and
inclusive learning environment that furthers equity, inclusion and
social justice. We actively seek candidates whose experiences,
teaching philosophies, and scholarly practice prepare them to
expand and contribute to that commitment.     Candidates

a focus on communities that have historically been, and continue to
be, underserved by schools (e.g. Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or
immigrant populations). All candidates must have an earned
doctorate and a demonstrated commitment to exemplary research that
yields high-quality scholarship with extramural funding
potential.
The Department of Curriculum and Instruction is committed to
building a culturally diverse educational environment. As we invest

racial, social, and economic justice as lenses for their research
and teaching.

conducting research, student advising, and teaching undergraduate
and graduate courses. Candidates must demonstrate the ability to
mentor undergraduate and graduate students, in particular BIPOC

who take a critical approach to their research and teaching with a
focus on education as a platform for social change. The candidate
must also have a commitment to ongoing research productivity and
demonstrated participation in the field (e.g., service in
professional organizations, service to academic journals).
The Department of Curriculum and Instruction (EDCI) offers
outstanding undergraduate and graduate programs of study for both
pre-service and in-service educators. The primary focus of our
faculty is the preparation of leaders to serve all levels of
education. Graduate students in EDCI may pursue a Master of Arts
degree in curriculum and instruction; a Doctor of Philosophy in
curriculum and instruction; or a Sixth-Year Diploma in professional
education. Graduate certificates are also available in certain
areas. EDCI faculty members conduct research reflecting their
interests in such areas as teacher education; language and
literacy; math and science education; social studies
education; and world language and bilingual education. They
