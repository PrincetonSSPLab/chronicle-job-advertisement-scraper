The Department of Sociology at the University of Oklahoma (OU)
invites applications at the rank of Assistant or Associate
Professor beginning in academic year 2022-23 in childhood and
health or well-being, broadly defined. This position is part of a
cross-campus university wide cluster hire in childhood well-being.
The goal is to build collaborations and transdisciplinary research
capacity over the next five years through strategic hires of 20
faculty with expertise in child well-being, advanced analytics, and
innovative measurement. This position in sociology is one of four
hires across departments at OU in the first year.  The
teaching load is two courses each semester (2/2).
We seek a sociologist, or transdisciplinary social scientist
from an allied discipline to be housed in Sociology, who
specializes in child well-being broadly defined, which could
involve a focus on health, trauma, adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs), socio-emotional learning and development, and/or public
health and/or public policy. This scholar will secure new sponsored
research dollars, attract and mentor top-level students, produce
high quality research and scholarship, and collaborate across
campuses and departments, such as OU’s Health Sciences Center and
the Early Childhood Education Institute (ECEI) and other new
institutes described below. We welcome expertise in a variety of
methodological approaches and from scholars who approach their work
with cultural respect, sensitivity, and competence. Preference will
be given to candidates who have either clear plans or a track
record of pursuing externally funded research, building on federal
and philanthropic interest in this growing field.
This position will benefit from and enhance current strengths in
the areas of childhood, family, gender, and inequality within our
department. Moreover, both the department and the university are
committed to building and supporting social scientific approaches
to understanding the role of health and health inequalities in
shaping the social world. This position will add to research areas
that align us with the University’s goals and establish the nexus
of childhood and health as a strength at the departmental level. In
line with the university’s strategic plan for OU to benefit the
state, nation, and beyond, we welcome an applied research focus,
one that informs solutions to societal challenges and grows
strengths in the areas of state and university partnerships and
program evaluation. Sociology’s strategic plan lists the creation
of an Oklahoma Social Research Lab, and this position will
contribute to that initiative already underway with several
research grants, including one focused on rural health and
childhood experiences in Oklahoma and another $4 million project
evaluating a substance use disorder intervention for pregnant and
parenting mothers. It is an exciting time to join our
department.

Why UNO?
The University of Nebraska at Omaha is fueled by its historical
ties to Omaha.  As the first municipal university in Omaha,
the early founders’ goal was to make higher education accessible
and affordable for the city’s residents. In 1968, the campus joined
the University of Nebraska system, and today has the unique role of
serving as the state’s metropolitan campus.
 
Accessibility remains a top priority in UNO’s mission and
vision.  Today, the campus is known for its student-centered
environment, its community engagement, and its dedication to
embracing students from all types of backgrounds.  UNO’s
ranking as the 
2020 Best College for LGBTQ+ Students In Nebraska reflects a
commitment to the Maverick values of access, inclusion and
diversity that make UNO a welcoming campus community, evidenced by
the numerous resources and support services offered by the
university.
The campus has built strong partnerships with local business,
education, government, arts, and civic organizations in the city.
UNO’s commitment to community engagement has landed UNO on the
President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for seven
consecutive years—the highest federal recognition a school can
receive for civic engagement.
This honor is but one of many points of pride for UNO. In 2019,
it was ranked in the top ten public institutions in the nation for
military friendliness by Military Times magazine for the fifth
consecutive year. Nearly 90 percent of UNO’s 15,500 students are
from Nebraska, and roughly 60 percent of recent alumni surveyed
report graduating with no debt or less than $5,000 in debt. It is
simply one of the most competitively priced institutions in the
region. UNO, while large enough to provide students with global
opportunities, thrives on its personal and close-knit campus
culture, where students come first and partnerships with the
community grow every day.  For more information about how UNO
embraces its mission, see

Assistant Professor -Forest Science and Climate Change -
Environmental Science, Policy, & Management

The Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management
(ESPM) at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) invites
applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor nine-month
faculty position in the area of Forest Science and Climate
Change.

ESPM is a multidisciplinary community of scholars and Cooperative
Extension Specialists from the biological, physical, and social
sciences and the humanities who conduct research, teaching, and
outreach to advance scientific understanding and develop solutions
for the world's pressing environmental problems. ESPM is home to a
top-ranked Ph.D. program in environmental science, environmental
studies and ecological/evolutionary biology. Our undergraduate
students have a choice of vibrant majors that span the disciplines
in the department.

We value diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as exemplified by
the following principles of community: we accept the intrinsic
relationship between diversity and excellence in all our endeavors;
we embrace open and equitable access to opportunities for learning
and development as our obligation and goal. ESPM recognizes that
DEI must be integrated with strategies that address the critical
environmental challenges facing humanity, including climate change,
food security, natural resource access and management,
biodiversity, environmental health, land use decision-making, and
maintaining sustainable living conditions. Financial and in-kind
resources are available to pursue activities that help accelerate
our efforts to achieve our equity and inclusion goals. Successful
candidates for our faculty position will demonstrate evidence of a
commitment to equity and inclusion through their research,
teaching, and/or service.

Forested ecosystems are central to the defining environmental
challenge of the 21st century: climate change. Forest area is
likely to shrink in the coming decades due to economically-driven
land conversion, drought, and wildfires. The changing climate's
effect on forested ecosystems has had tangible and serious impacts.
If humanity is to avert the worst impacts of climate change,
critical decisions must be made in the coming decade on how to best
manage these ecosystems to mitigate carbon emissions while meeting
other societal needs for healthy forests as we move towards a
nearly carbon-neutral economy.

We seek applicants whose research addresses varied aspects of
Forest Science and Climate Change. This innovative research will
include field-based studies on forest ecosystems. Findings are to
be communicated to policy makers, managers, colleagues and the
broader public to further collaborative efforts.

Anticipated teaching duties may include an upper-division class in
applied forest ecology, teaching at the UC Forestry Field Camp
program, collaboration with other campus and statewide programs
that focus on forest and climate science broadly, and additional
teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels in relation to
department needs.

ESPM is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty,
including dual career couples and single parents. We are also
interested in candidates who have had non-traditional career paths,
who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved
excellence in careers outside academia.

needs of accompanying partners and spouses, please visit: http://ofew.berkeley.edu/new-faculty.

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

The CSUSB Department of Music provides students with a rigorous

and students, all with a continual focus on artistic expression.
Consistent with the university's mission, the department is also
committed to serving the campus and Inland Empire communities
through on-going performance and educational initiatives. Modern
musicians have access to more kinds of music than ever before in
history, and CSUSB's music curriculum—with courses in electronic
music, performance, world music, historical studies, music
education and music theory—reflects that diversity in that it
offers programs for students who wish to enter the teaching
profession, become a professional musician, work in the music
industry, pursue an advanced degree, or simply enrich their
education.

Many graduates of the department's Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of
Music programs find employment as elementary, secondary, and
university music educators, as performers in symphony orchestras,
opera, musical theater, and jazz settings, and as composers,
arrangers, producers, and technicians in the entertainment
industry. Others apply their musical background to careers in
business, law, medicine, and library science. The department's
Liberal Studies courses provide elementary teachers with the
experience and knowledge necessary to make music an effective tool
in their classrooms. Also offered are minors in Music, Music
Technology, and Alternative Styles, which provide students in other
majors with the opportunity to enrich their educational
experiences.

402499,Assistant/Associate Professor of Multicultural Community Counseling (LPCC),https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/402499/assistant-associate-professor-of-multicultural-community-counseling-lpcc-/,False,San Diego State University,"California, United States",Salary Commensurate with experience,,"The Counseling and School Psychology Department seeks an
assistant or associate professor to contribute to the preparation
of licensed professional multicultural community counselors (LPCC).
We seek a colleague with a clinical license or who is
license-eligible and can work successfully in our non-traditional,
social justice-oriented Community-Based Block Program learning
community.
The Community Based Block (CBB) Program is a special unit within
the Department of Counseling and School Psychology. Founded in
1973, CBB is a two-year, graduate-professional counselor
preparation program that culminates in a 60-unit Master of Science
in Counseling, with a specialization in Licensed Professional
Clinical Counseling (LPCC). The 48-year-old program uses social
justice theory, affective experiential multicultural education, and
democratic shared governance processes to help students develop the
proficiencies they will need to become effective multicultural
counselors and social justice change agents in communities,
schools, colleges, and social service agencies. Students are
prepared to apply a variety of counseling interventions and
psychotherapeutic techniques to identify and remediate cognitive,
mental, and emotional issues, for the purposes of improving mental
health. These interventions and techniques help individuals and
communities deal adequately with life situations, reduce stress,
experience growth, change behavior and make well-informed
decisions. Students will also develop counseling skills, including
relationship building, group dynamics and process; the academic
skills of critical thinking, systematic inquiry, and effective
written and oral communication; and the personal growth experiences
necessary to enable graduates to use their skills for the benefit
of clients and communities. The CBB program also prepares students
to adapt counseling skills to the needs of different populations to
prepare them to become truly competent multicultural counselors.
CBB Graduates work in community-based organizations or colleges or
have gone on to matriculate in further graduate studies, such as
MFT, school counseling, school psychology, or to doctoral
studies.
The program is called “community based” because it has always
been held off campus in the heart of two of San Diego’s multiethnic
neighborhoods and because it creates a learning community in which
a team of faculty and a carefully selected group of students
“partner” in the learning process, each cohort of students helping
to structure its learning experience. It is a “block” program
because all classes are required of all students, who stay together
as a group for the entire program.
In 2014, CBB moved from a 1-year MA program to a 2-year Master
of Counseling program. In CBB outcomes assessments, students and
graduates have expressed strong interest in licensure and doctoral
studies incorporating CBB pedagogy and philosophies. The program
waited in great anticipation for the professional clinical
counseling license legislation to be enacted in the State of
California in 2012. This license provides more job opportunities
and professional expertise for practitioners trained by the CBB
program. This expanded program places special emphasis on
responding to the need for community counselors educated and
trained in the California Mental Health Services Act recovery and
trauma-informed model of care, which theorizes that personal
empowerment is imperative to recovery and values the establishment
of meaningful social connections within the community.

Graduate practice-ready, competent and confident veterinarians
who will serve rural and regional communities across Texas;
Provide access to affordable, high-quality veterinary medical
education for Texans;

advanced clinical training in internships and residencies;
Support sustainability of livestock industries as they feed
growing state, national, and global populations; and

that comprise the Texas Tech University System.  The TTU SVM
will maintain populations of domestic animals, and the region is
home to large numbers of production animals and wildlife providing
further opportunities for field-based research.

Panhandle.  With a metropolitan statistical area population
approaching 270,000, it offers attractions of a larger city while
holding true to its agricultural roots (https://www.visitamarillo.com). 
Amarillo serves as a center of services for a large, multi-state
area and is home to many agricultural associations such as the
Texas Cattle Feeders Association and the American Quarter Horse

department-like structures) within the School, the successful
candidates will report to the Associate Dean for Academic and
Student Affairs.

Additional comments:

The curriculum is grounded on general veterinary practice in
rural agricultural and regional communities. A central function of
subject-matter experts is to provide instruction such that
graduates can competently and confidently practice veterinary
medicine at a distance from referral hospitals.
Those with experience in rural and regional community practices

Jazz Studies, the Major and Specialization in Electroacoustic
Studies, and the Major in Music which houses the Specializations in

Faculty. Student collaboration among the various visual and
performing arts students continues to grow as new programs and
avenues of research/creation develop. For example, the department’s

in the Film Animation Major. This particular collaboration has even
broader reach as it includes participation from programs at sister

Graduate practice-ready, competent and confident veterinarians
who will serve rural and regional communities across Texas;
Provide access to affordable, high-quality veterinary medical
education for Texans;
Develop a research-intensive School that enhances and
complements the strengths of TTU and Texas Tech University Health

expertise in veterinary medicine, food- and fiber-animal
production, and the health sciences;
Provide opportunities for graduate education and research, and
advanced clinical training in internships and residencies;
Support sustainability of livestock industries as they feed
growing state, national, and global populations; and
Improve human, animal, and ecosystem health by integrating
innovative One Health activities into our educational, scholarship,
and service activities.

 
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Council on
Education (COE) granted the School provisional accreditation in
2021.  The School enrolled its inaugural class of 64 students
in August 2021 and classes began 16th of August, 2021. 
Admisions is underway for the second class of 80 students.
 
The TTU SVM is adjacent the Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center (TTUHSC) regional campus in Amarillo.  The
state-of-the-art 260,000 square-feet of buildings support all
aspects of the School and include approximately 26,000 square-feet
of dedicated research laboratories.  In addition, teaching
laboratories and classrooms may serve as research sites when
conducting scholarship.  The TTUHSC also maintains a vivarium
on their campus as well as other core facilities in Amarillo in
addition to the numerous core facilities across the institutions
that comprise the Texas Tech University System.  The TTU SVM
will maintain populations of domestic animals, and the region is
home to large numbers of production animals and wildlife providing
further opportunities for field-based research. 
 
Amarillo is a vibrant and growing community in the Texas
Panhandle.  With a metropolitan statistical area population
approaching 270,000, it offers attractions of a larger city while
holding true to its agricultural roots (https://www.visitamarillo.com). 
Amarillo serves as a center of services for a large, multi-state
area and is home to many agricultural associations such as the
Texas Cattle Feeders Association and the American Quarter Horse
Association.
 
Responsibilities of the Positions

Contribute to the TTU SVM’s instruction, scholarship, and
service activities. The distribution of effort toward each activity
will be individualized for each faculty member and outlined in the
letter of appointment. 

It is expected that tenure-track faculty members will establish
extramural support of their scholarship and this will include
support for graduate students and opportunities for involvement of
professional students. This expectation is proportional to
percentage of effort assigned to scholarship in the letter of
appointment.


Contribute to activities necessary for accreditation from the
American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education, other
regulatory or accreditation approvals, and admit and deliver the
curriculum to the students of the professional degree program.
Development and participation in the School’s research
enterprise and PhD program

curricular development will focus on Small Animal Medicine and
Surgery courses.

The curricular framework has been developed based on Competency
Based Veterinary Education (CBVE; see

anticipation of instructing students in their clinical year such as
expanding the clinical caseload; supporting the practice with
advanced diagnostics, therapeutics, and surgical support; advancing
the education of veterinary practitioners; and supervision of
clinical year students. 
Until such time that it is necessary to create departments (or
department-like structures) within the School, the successful
candidates will report to the Associate Dean for Academic and
Student Affairs.
Participation on various School committees.
Additional comments:

The curriculum is grounded on general veterinary practice in
rural agricultural and regional communities. A central function of
subject-matter experts is to provide instruction such that
graduates can competently and confidently practice veterinary
medicine at a distance from referral hospitals.
Those with experience in rural and regional community practices
will provide important feedback that will inform the admission
process, instruction, and continuing education.

pool of candidates have applied.
 
All faculty and staff are expected to foster the Core Values
of the School.  Contribution to fostering the School’s values
will be evaluated as part of your annual performance review.
 
Background
The School and the focus of its comprehensive veterinary medical
education program are founded on the following objectives:

Graduate practice-ready, competent and confident veterinarians
who will serve rural and regional communities across Texas;
Provide access to affordable, high-quality veterinary medical
education for Texans;
Develop a research-intensive School that enhances and
complements the strengths of TTU and Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center (TTUHSC), and addresses the needs for research and
expertise in veterinary medicine, food- and fiber-animal
production, and the health sciences;
Provide opportunities for graduate education and research, and
advanced clinical training in internships and residencies;
Support sustainability of livestock industries as they feed
growing state, national, and global populations; and
Improve human, animal, and ecosystem health by integrating
innovative One Health activities into our educational, scholarship,
and service activities.

 
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Council on
Education (COE) granted the TTU SVM provisional accreditation in
2021.  The School enrolled its inaugural class of 64 students
in August 2021 and classes began 16th of August, 2021. 
Admissions is underway for the second class of 80 students.
 
The TTU SVM is adjacent the Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center (TTUHSC) regional campus in Amarillo.  The
state-of-the-art 260,000 square-feet of buildings support all
aspects of the School and include approximately 26,000 square-feet
of dedicated research laboratories.  In addition, teaching
laboratories and classrooms may serve as research sites when
conducting scholarship.  The TTUHSC also maintains a vivarium
on their campus as well as other core facilities in Amarillo in
addition to the numerous core facilities across the institutions
that comprise the Texas Tech University System.  The TTU SVM
will maintain populations of domestic animals, and the region is
home to large numbers of production animals and wildlife providing
further opportunities for field-based research. 
 
 
Amarillo is a vibrant and growing community in the Texas
Panhandle.  With a metropolitan statistical area population
approaching 270,000, it offers attractions of a larger city while
holding true to its agricultural roots (https://www.visitamarillo.com). 
Amarillo serves as a center of services for a large, multi-state
area and is home to many agricultural associations such as the
Texas Cattle Feeders Association and the American Quarter Horse
Association.
 
Responsibilities of the Positions

Contribute to the TTU SVM’s instruction, scholarship, and
service activities. The distribution of effort toward each activity
will be individualized for each faculty member and outlined in the
letter of appointment. 

It is expected that tenure-track faculty members will establish
extramural support of their scholarship and this will include
support for graduate students and opportunities for involvement of
professional students. This expectation is proportional to
percentage of effort assigned to scholarship in the letter of
appointment.


Contribute to activities necessary for accreditation from the
American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education, other
regulatory or accreditation approvals, and admit and deliver the
curriculum to the students of the professional degree program.
Development and participation in the School’s research
enterprise and PhD program
Curricular development and related activities. Most
curricular development will focus on the two lecture based
anesthesia courses, the Clinical and Professional Skills
laboratories where student surgeries will take place, and the
clinical rotation for anesthesia.

The curricular framework has been developed based on Competency
Based Veterinary Education (CBVE; see 
AAVMC.org), and is designed to be vertically and horizontally
integrated.
Curricular development will require teamwork to effectively
develop course syllabi and content relative to this integration,
and to accomplish desired outcomes.
Curricular mapping of course-specific learning objectives with
curricular outcomes.
Delivery of the curriculum within the professional program.
This might include serving as instructor of record for various
courses, contributing lectures to other courses, or participating
in laboratories.


Participation in anesthesia instructional delivery of Clinical
Skills Laboratories.
Participation and delivery of Clinical Case Presentations
courses.
Clinical service, for the purpose of veterinary student
clinical instruction, may be provided through specific private
practice sites that serve as clinical learning centers for
students. Effort may be directed towards developing the site in
anticipation of instructing students in their clinical year such as
expanding the clinical caseload; supporting the practice with
advanced anesthesia training; advancing the education of veterinary
practitioners; and supervision of clinical year students.  The
TTU SVM does not have a teaching hospital and thus clinical service
will be limited as per above.
Until such time that it is necessary to create departments (or
department-like structures) within the School, the successful
candidates will report to the Associate Dean for Academic and
Student Affairs.
Participation on various School committees.
Additional comments:

The curriculum is grounded on general veterinary practice in
rural agricultural and regional communities. A central function of
subject-matter experts is to provide instruction such that
graduates can competently and confidently practice veterinary
medicine at a distance from referral hospitals.
Those with experience in rural and regional community practices
will provide important feedback that will inform the admission
process, instruction, and continuing education. 



 
Qualifications

Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia, or candidates with a PhD in a
related field.
Candidates with experience in both large and companion
animals.

 
Texas Tech is a Hispanic Serving Institution and has a long
history of serving first-generation students.  A commitment to
working with diverse student populations and first-generation
students is required on the cover letter.
 
Salary
A competitive salary and benefits package will be provided
commensurate with qualifications and experience, and when
applicable, start-up funding will be provided to support research
program development.  These are full-time, 12-month, academic
appointments.  Appointments may be tenure- or non-tenure-track

appropriate, non-tenure-track appointments will be at a fitting
rank within the Professor of Practice title (i.e., Assistant
Professor of Practice or Associate Professor of Practice).

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to
select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position. Candidates

match will not be considered outside of the equivalency
process.
The equivalency review is an independent
process for district wide disciplines that is separate from the
recruitment process to fill a vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline

that are equivalent to those shown in the minimum qualifications
section of the job posting. For disciplines that are unique to a
specific campus the equivalency may be done by the hiring committee
along with an Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the

equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

About The University of Texas at El Paso:

The University of Texas at El Paso is one of America's leading
Hispanic-serving Universities, located at the western-most tip of
Texas, where three states and two countries converge along the Rio
Grande River at the heart of the U.S.-Mexico border. UTEP is a
public research university that strives to increase access to
excellent higher education to transform lives. Ninety-four percent
of UTEP's nearly 25,000 students are minorities, 83% of whom are
Hispanic and half of whom are the first generation in their
families to attend college. At UTEP, students have access to 168
bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in nine colleges
and schools. UTEP is the only open-access, top tier research
university in America, yet its retention rates exceed those of
selective institutions.

Located in the second-most educated city in Texas, UTEP is
recognized as one of the best research universities in the country
for connecting students with the community around them. It is one
of the only 28 institutions in the U.S. and 3 in Texas to hold both
top tier research and community engagement distinctions from the
Carnegie Foundation.

UTEP advances discovery of public value and positively impacts the
health, culture, education, and economy of the community it serves.
With more than $108 million in total annual research expenditures,
the University is ranked among the top 5% of colleges and
universities in research and fifth in Texas for federal research
expenditures at public universities.

The University employs approximately 4,000 faculty, staff, and
students. It has one of the lowest out-of-pocket costs of any
research university in the U.S., underscoring its commitment to
offer an exceptional education at a great value. Almost 25% of
graduates from the poorest backgrounds reach the top income
quintile, placing UTEP in the top 20 universities in America for
social mobility.

UTEP's award-winning, sustainably designed campus landscape and
unique Bhutanese architecture create an energizing and tranquil
oasis in the bustling El Paso-Juarez metroplex of more than 2
million residents. El Paso is a highly livable, bicultural
community of more than 800,000 people that offers affordable homes
and attractive neighborhoods. It has been repeatedly named among
the safest large U.S. cities and is one of the largest bilingual
binational, multicultural communities in the Western
Hemisphere.

El Paso experiences almost 300 days of sunshine annually, and
residents enjoy outdoor activities year-round. The City of El Paso
is adjacent to the state of New Mexico and the country of Mexico,
making it an ideal venue for academic programs and research studies
on topics of national interest, such as bilingual
education/language acquisition, border environment and immigration,
environmental sustainability and infrastructure, health
disparities, and international trade and commerce.

Job No: 496420
Work Type: Staff
Location: Newark
Categories: Full Time, Trainers & Educators


Context of the Job:

The Diving Safety Officer/SCUBA Instructor reports to the Deputy
Dean and has a dotted reporting line to the Director of
Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). Under the general
description of Diving Safety Officer/ SCUBA Instructor, the
incumbent will be expected to act as both the Diving Safety Officer
as well as the instructor for the SCUBA courses offered through the
University. The context of the job has been split into two sections
for clarity.

Diving Safety Officer (DSO):

The University of Delaware is an AAUS (American Academy of
Underwater Sciences) institution and therefore is required to meet
all AAUS standards in diving practices and guidelines. This
requirement extends beyond research diving and includes any study
abroad courses that also contain any use of SCUBA. The DSO is
expected to certify new AAUS divers, provide dive experience
refreshers, and training to existing AAUS divers, maintain a good
standing within AAUS (i.e. keeping log books and records of all
diving activity), as well as provide letters of reciprocity for any
divers going to another institution. It is preferred this position
be filled by someone who already has, or could acquire O 2 and
first aid/CPR instructor status. Additionally, this role requires
the individual to work and routinely meet with Environmental Health
and Safety (EHS) and Student Health Services, while following all
Federal, state and University guidelines pertaining to HIPAA
confidentiality. Success in the job depends on successfully passing
and maintaining the AAUS requirements.



SCUBA Instructor:

The University of Delaware offers SCUBA classes to undergraduate
students during all semesters (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer),
averaging 120-180 students annually. The courses offered currently
include Open Water and Advanced Open Water, with the opportunity to
add additional courses (e.g. Rescue Diver, Nitrox, etc.). It is
also expected that all university owned SCUBA gear be maintained to
the highest standard (including but not limited to compressor, dive
tanks, Buoyancy Control Devices, diving computers, etc.). This
position would require routine teaching on the main campus in
Newark, DE, specifically the Carpenter Sports Bldg. Due to the
requirements of student/instructor ratio (7:1) for certification
organizations, the SCUBA instructor would be responsible for
recruiting and identifying additional adjunct instructors
(temporary staff) to stay within the safety rules of pool
instruction. As described above, this role would require the
applicant to work and routinely meet with Environmental Health and
Safety (EHS), and Student Health Services. Additionally, it is
expected that coordination and communication would regularly occur
with the Carpenter Sports Bldg. pool facility to schedule access to
the pool, timing of classes and scheduling of lifeguards. Lastly,
as many internationally recognized certifying organizations only
allow certified instructors to distribute and sell material, the
individual filling this position would act as a conduit for the
students in the class to obtain necessary materials. The SCUBA
certification is optional, meaning that students can take the class
without receiving certificate however it is expected that the
instructor should be able to certify the students that are
interested.

Major Responsibilities:

physics, COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES



INTRODUCTION/POSITION: Candidates with expertise in particle
astrophysics or related data science are especially invited to
apply. We seek creative and innovative individuals who have a
strong background in at least one of these research areas, who will
also engage in high-quality teaching and mentoring at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels, and who are eager to work in a
collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment and to
become leaders in their fields. Astroparticle physics is a
longstanding specialty of the Department of Physics and Astronomy
and the Bartol Research Institute. Our particle astrophysics
faculty work on cosmic rays, neutrinos and gamma rays and include
members of the IceCube and IceCube-Gen2, ARA and RNO-G, ANITA and
PUEO, the Pierre Auger, VERITAS and CTA Collaborations. Candidates
should outline how they strengthen or complement these activities
on the experimental, phenomenological, or theoretical side. The
faculty in the department also has expertise and developed research
programs in synergistic astrophysics, space physics, and data
science.

The successful candidate will benefit from a competitive start-up
budget and additional support for participation in research related
to NSF EPSCoR award #2019597 ‘the IceCube EPSCoR Initiative -
IceCube and the Data Revolution (IEI)'. Nonetheless, prior research
with IceCube is not required and the research plan may be broader
and include activities not connected to the IEI.

This tenure-track position offers the opportunity to develop a
career at a research-intensive department. In addition to pursuing
an excellent research program, the successful candidate will be
expected to provide effective instruction and advising to a diverse
population of graduate and undergraduate students and to

elsewhere), teaching (including teaching classes within the UD
Physics and Astronomy Department and mentoring UD students involved
in research), and a small fraction of their workload dedicated to
service tasks to the Department, College, or University and
academic community (such as reviewing paper manuscripts or grant
proposals). UD is a Research-1 University which offers a low
teaching workload in the Department of Physics and Astronomy,
typically one class per semester, such that sufficient time is
available for developing a research-intensive career. The
successful candidate also will participate in meetings and
activities of the IceCube EPSCoR Initiative.

THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY AT UD:

The Department of Physics
and Astronomy (DPA) at the University of Delaware is within the
College Arts and Sciences.

The DPA traces its ancestry back to a small teaching department,
which began in 1920. By the early 1960s the department had expanded
into a major research department with the construction of Sharp
Laboratory and the development of a full-scale doctoral program.
The arrival of the Bartol Research Institute in the late 1970s
transformed developing research areas in astrophysics and particle
physics into full-fledged programs for Ph.D. students. In July
2005, the Bartol Research Institute merged with the Department of
Physics and Astronomy, becoming a research center within the
Department. Several faculty of the DPA are also associate with the
UD's Data Science Institute.

Today, more than 30 faculty do research at the DPA in its two main
themes, which are quantum science and physics of the universe. The
physics of the universe theme includes astronomy, space physics,
high-energy particle and particle astrophysics. Research in
particle astrophysics ranges from theory and phenomenology to
computational physics and experimental projects with decadal time
scales.

High-Energy Astroparticle Physics is a longstanding specialty of
the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Bartol Research
Institute. The Bartol Research Institute additionally brings a
tradition in research in Antarctica. Among other research in space
physics and astrophysics, it is active in several research projects
at Antarctica, such as IceCube, ARA, and balloon missions, and is
also involved in gamma-ray, neutrino, and cosmic-ray experiments at
other sites.

The College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Delaware offers exceptional
educational experiences including integrated instruction, research
and public engagement. With 24 academic departments and more than
25 centers, programs and institutes, the College serves close to
7,000 undergraduate students and over 1,000 graduate students with
CAS majors, but also every single University student through

varied experiences of Black people across the African Diaspora, our
mission is to apply the production of knowledge to uplift and
empower our communities, ourselves, and to inspire social change
and permanent liberation.

In addition to Africana Studies methodologies, our faculty are
trained in a range of disciplines including art and design, art

anthropology, political science, theology, and literature. Faculty
teaching and research interests and student major concentrations
intersect the department's four pillars:

• Visual and Material Culture

Together, the Africana Studies faculty at UD cultivate and advance
the department's mission to engage in research that is accessible
and relevant to Black communities and to practice teaching that
develops deeper and broader understandings of justice and freedom
in our society. Our teaching is central to our mission, as Africana
faculty view our classrooms as sites of change-making toward more
just futures. The Continuing Track Assistant Professor position

Context 
The University of Oklahoma, and particularly the Dodge Family
College of Art and Sciences, has invested heavily in Native
American academics and scholarship. Faculty engaged in Native
American topics are both concentrated in the Native Nations Center
and Department of Native American Studies, and diffused across
campus in a broad range of disciplines. As
well, the OU Libraries’ Western
History Collections and the Sam Noble Museum of Natural
History’s Native Americans Languages Collection hold an
extensive assemblage of Native American
materials such as oral histories, manuscripts, photographs,
newspapers/journals, and ephemera. With this faculty hire,
SLIS will be joining in and contributing to this area of
institutional emphasis. The faculty member hired will have ample
opportunity to build community and collaborate with
scholars in a variety of departments and
disciplines.  
Oklahoma is home to 39 federally recognized Native American
tribes, more than any other state. Nearly 10% of the state’s
population identifies as Native American or Alaska Native (9.4%,
Census Bureau estimates 2019). Oklahoma is also home
to museums/centers around the state that represent
Indigenous populations: the newly-opened First Americans
Museum, the Chickasaw Cultural Center, the Cherokee
Heritage Center, etc. An Indigenous
knowledge scholar would be situated within Oklahoma’s
extraordinary Native American landscape, where community research
could contribute both to OU and to the needs and issues of
community partners. 
Norman, Oklahoma, located 20 miles south of
Oklahoma City, enjoys more than 225 days of sunshine each
year and often ranks highly on “best places to live”
rankings. The city offers a culturally rich and vibrant
environment that includes outstanding schools, a low cost of
living, and an excellent array of dining, arts,
recreation, and sporting events.  
The School of Library and Information Studies at the University
of Oklahoma was established in 1929 and is situated within the
Dodge Family College of Arts and Sciences. It has recently become
an affiliate member of the iSchool consortium.
The School has faculty in residence at both the Norman
and Tulsa campuses, and faculty teach students at both locations,
and online students in a variety of locations.
The School has a long-standing MLIS and Bachelor
of Arts, along with a new Ph.D. in Information Studies, a new
Bachelor of Science, and several new graduate certificate
programs.  
The University of Oklahoma is a Carnegie R1 public research
university known for excellence in teaching, research, and
community engagement. We embrace and encourage creativity and
innovation in Oklahoma and beyond.

About the College/Department:
Eastern Kentucky University is a regional, coeducational, public
institution of higher education offering general and liberal arts
programs, pre-professional and professional training in education
and various other fields at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels. Located in Richmond, Madison County, Kentucky, EKU has a
distinguished record of more than a century of educational service
to the Commonwealth. Eastern Kentucky University is committed to
access, equal opportunity, dignity, respect, and inclusion for all
people, as integral to a learning environment in which intellectual
creativity and diversity thrives.

Situated near the heart of the Bluegrass, Richmond is served by a
network of major highways that make EKU easily accessible from all
parts of Kentucky and surrounding states. Richmond is 26 miles
southeast of Lexington, Kentucky. Interstate Highways I-75
(north-south) and I-64 (east-west) make the metropolitan areas of
Cincinnati, 112 miles to the north, and Louisville, 110 miles to
the west, within convenient distance by automobile. Richmond is
also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and
Kentucky Route 52 from the east and west. The Bluegrass, Mountain,
Daniel Boone, and Cumberland Parkways provide even greater
accessibility by automobile since the city is located near the
convergence of these arterial highways into the interstate
system.

EKU is dedicated to high-quality instruction, scholarship, and
service, and places emphasis on the three in that order. Through
its colleges and schools, the University seeks to offer quality
instruction at a variety of degree levels in general education, the
arts, the sciences, business, education, pre-professional and
professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through
consultative services, continuing education, and the extended
