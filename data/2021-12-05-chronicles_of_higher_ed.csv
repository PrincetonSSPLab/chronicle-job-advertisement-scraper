carrying out a parallel search for a tenure-track eligible Kentucky
State Climatologist position at the associate or full-professor
rank. Together, these new hires will provide students in the
Meteorology Program with enhanced opportunities and unique pathways
for post-graduate achievements.
The WKU Meteorology Program was founded in 2008 and is the
largest meteorology program in the Mid-South, maintaining around 70
undergraduate students. The foundation for the WKU Meteorology
Program is centered on innovative applied learning and research,
with a strong reputation for excellence and robust student success.

professional initiative that provides official university weather
and incident decision-support services. White Squirrel Weather also
operates multiple hyperlocal/microclimate weather stations that are
located at various facilities across WKU campuses, the Commonwealth
of Kentucky, and elsewhere. The Disaster Science Operations Center
is a brand new multi-disciplinary applied research unit that allows
students to produce multi-media weather content and real-time
hazard monitoring. The College Heights Atmospheric Observatory for
Students (CHAOS Lab) serves as a meteorological monitoring,
prediction, and research lab for students. An award-winning Severe
Weather Forecasting Field Course offers upper-division Meteorology
majors an opportunity to perform real-time forecasting in a
fast-paced severe storm environment that serves as a capstone to
their academic program. An Atmospheric Computing Research lab
allows students to develop computing skills in areas of big data
processing and visualization for various meteorological and
climatological research endeavors. The WKU Meteorology Program is
also affiliated with the Kentucky Climate Center, home to
the Kentucky State Climatologist. As part of the Kentucky Climate
Center, the Kentucky Mesonet operates a
research-grade statewide infrastructure for weather and climate
monitoring, and serves as the official source of climatological
observations for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Kentucky Climate
Center maintains active affiliations with the National Centers for
Environmental Information, the National Weather Service, the
Midwestern Regional Climate Center, and other non-federal
organizations, and is actively engaged with the Midwest Drought
