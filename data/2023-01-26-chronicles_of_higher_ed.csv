*EQUIVALENCY
The Ventura County Community College
District, in its desire to select outstanding faculty members from
the largest possible pool of qualified applicants, recognizes the
fact that candidates may attain expertise in a discipline through a
variety of means. Certain combinations of education, experience and
other accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as
equal to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.
Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency
(Download
PDF reader) with their application for review by the District
wide Equivalency Committee.

Example:
Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.
Candidate's transcripts state: “Master's degree in agricultural
science”.
 Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in the
example do not EXACTLY MATCH the degree listed in the minimum
qualifications section, this candidate MUST complete the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency
(Download
PDF reader) in order to be considered. When completing the
form, be sure to explain in detail how your qualifications are
equivalent to the required minimum qualifications. Do not assume
that you do not need to submit a Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency because your degree is similar to a degree stated in
the minimum qualifications. Degree titles that are not an exact
match will not be considered outside of the equivalency
process.
The equivalency review is an independent process for
district wide disciplines that is separate from the recruitment
process to fill a vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts
that is coordinated by an Academic Senate President will review the
equivalency materials and make a recommendation as to whether or
not the applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are
equivalent to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of
the job posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific
campus the equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along
with an Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process. 

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD
Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD
Administrative Policy 7211.

Presentations at academic conferences are supported with annual
travel funds. Special funds provided to the Ethnic Studies programs
at CSUN also support faculty travel and projects.

Tenure-track faculty members participate in shared governance,

service assignments.

AIS faculty mentor students, especially those involved with the
American Indian Student Association, and they work with members of
the American Indian community in Los Angeles County. The American

Pierce College District is student-centered and mission-driven to ensure that all our students thrive and reach their fullest potential. As an institution committed to antiracism, we are action-oriented and intentional in dismantling every systemic barrier that prevents Black and Brown student excellence and liberation. 
As Pierce College deepens its commitment to racial equity, it is of the highest priority that we focus our tenure-track and permanent status faculty hiring process to seek faculty with the expertise to lead our institution in serving Black and Brown students. This cluster hire is an opportunity for the college community to continue to act upon our values but more importantly for the empowering of our students' self-efficacy, for cultivating sense of belonging, and for the diversity of our entire student body, especially Black and Brown students, being reflected in a position of power in the classroom. We are fortunate that the Washington state legislature recognizes this through SB 5194 in its efforts to address student areas of inequities with the funding of additional faculty positions.  Learn more about this year’s faculty cluster hire here: https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/hr-faculty-cluster-hire.
We are excited to invite you to bring your lived experiences and authentic selves to contribute to discourse and action in supporting Black and Brown students.
About the Program
The Pierce College Applied Business Department is a collaborative group of faculty and staff members that embrace diversity of thought and experience to offer racially equitable learning experiences that develop key business industry knowledge, skills, and abilities. In collaboration with an engaged advisory committee, the applied business department offers dynamic programming that aligns with the high-demand skills of the workforce including human resource management, project management, social media, marketing, supervision, and entrepreneurship.

The program is purposefully designed to be compatible with students' busy lives by offering a variety of modalities (campus, online, hybrid) and a course schedule that supports students setting the pace for their academic journey. All certificates of the program build towards our applied associate degrees.

TENURE TRACK POSITION in POPULATION MEDICINE, SUSTAINABLE
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY


Location: Kennett Square, PA
Open Date: Nov 17, 2022
Deadline:

The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine
invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position
(Assistant/Associate/Full Professor) within the Section of
Population Medicine in the 
Department of Clinical Studies-New Bolton Center. Professional
responsibilities will be divided between research (75%) and
academic duties (25%), including teaching of veterinary students,
interaction with stakeholders in the agricultural industry, and
contribution to the newly-formed Center for Stewardship Agriculture
and Food Security (CSAFS),
which was launched in October, 2022.

The candidate will join a vibrant team of faculty within the
Section performing innovative research in rumen microbial genomics
and methane mitigation, upcycling of discarded food for production
animal feedstuffs, animal health and productivity, reproduction,
agricultural animal behavior, welfare and wellbeing, geospatial
modeling of disease, biostatistics, food safety and antimicrobial
usage, and global food security and agricultural entrepreneurship.
The research team works closely with clinical production medicine
faculty within the Section, who perform field investigation with
dairy and swine farms within the local area, throughout the
Commonwealth and beyond.

The mission of the new CSAFS is to foster the responsible use of
agricultural and natural resources while feeding the world's
burgeoning population, with the aim of advancing farming practices
that will bolster sustainable development. The nascent CSAFS
provides the opportunity for interaction throughout the School via
collaboration with other departments and initiatives at Penn Vet
including 
Pathobiology, 
Wildlife Futures, and the 
Institute for Infectious and Zoonotic Disease; with initiatives
across the University, including the Kleinman Energy Center and
Department
of Landscape Architecture at the Weitzman School of Design, the
Penn Water Center,
the Wharton Business
School, the PRECISE
Center and the Clean
Energy Conversions Laboratory, both associated with the School
of Engineering and Applied Science, the Galapagos Education and
Research Alliance, and the Earth and Environmental Science
Department, both from the School of Arts and Science, as well
as Penn Global; and with
strategic agricultural and environmentally-focused entities in the
local, national and international communities.

As a tenure-track faculty member, the successful candidate will be
expected to develop an independent research program. Skills in
obtaining competitive extramural funding to sustain such research
are crucial. Additional expectations include active participation
in the Section's core teaching of nutritional, metabolic,
physiological, animal health and production, and/or epidemiological
concepts to veterinary students, with the option to develop new
elective coursework. The Section has a strong history of research
supporting the dairy industry, a major contributor to
Pennsylvania's economy, and we encourage applications from
candidates whose work will integrate new concepts and research
discoveries into solving issues related to dairy sustainability,
efficiency, environmental impact, and mitigation of carbon
footprint, including modeling of nutrient flows (nitrogen,
phosphorus, carbon) within the farm.

The successful candidate has the potential to access the clinical,
teaching and research units on the New Bolton Center Campus,
including the Veterinary School's 200-cow Marshak Dairy; the
250-sow Swine Teaching & Research Center; approximately 250
acres of crop and pasture land; and the facilities and expertise of
the internationally renowned New Bolton Center Hospital for Large
Animals. Laboratory space is available dependent on the
individual's programmatic needs.

New Bolton Center is located on 700 rolling acres in beautiful
Chester County, Pennsylvania, with easy access to numerous dairy
farms in southeastern Pennsylvania. The campus is only 35 miles
from Philadelphia, combining the advantages of a rural setting with
those of a nearby major metropolitan center.

We seek candidates who embrace and reflect diversity in the
broadest sense.


Qualifications
Applicants must hold a VMD/DVM or equivalent degree, and/or a PhD,
with advanced training in fields applicable to the balance between
environmental sustainability of farm animal agriculture and food
security. Preference will be given to candidates who will develop
their own investigative niche while contributing to collaborative
scholarship as an active member of the Section of Population
Medicine and the CSAFS.


Application Instructions
The deadline for application is December 31, 2022 or until the
position is filled. Questions about the position can be directed to
Dr. Andrew van Eps, Search Committee Chair; email vaneps@vet.upenn.edu; or Dr.

Richard E. and Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow
Position in Environmental Engineering at Bucknell
University

Job No: 497181
Position Type: full-time
Location: Lewisburg, PA
Categories: Civil & Environmental Engineering

The Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department at
Bucknell University invites applications for a Richard E. and
Yvonne Smith Postdoc-to-Tenure-Track Fellow position in
Environmental Engineering, starting in August 2023. The Smith PTT
Fellowship Program promotes pedagogical and institutional
excellence through diversification of faculty and curricula at the
University. Richard and Yvonne Smith were people of great
intellectual curiosity and humility, with uplifting and encouraging
spirits and a generous hospitality that was a foundation for
promoting inclusion and belonging at Bucknell. They reached out to
and engaged with students and colleagues in ways that left a
profound and positive impact on the institution. In that spirit, we
are seeking candidates from diverse backgrounds who have an active
intellectual life that they wish to share with the Bucknell
community. Candidates from groups underrepresented among faculty in
higher education are strongly encouraged to apply, and we hope that
you will. It would be a privilege to learn more about you, and we
would like for you to get to know us as well!

The CEE Department at Bucknell offers B.S. and M.S. degree programs
in civil engineering (CENG) and environmental engineering (EVEG).
The Department's mission is to prepare the next generation of
leaders in the stewardship of our natural and built environments,
for the benefit of the planet, communities, and people. The
hallmarks of a Bucknell CEE education include outstanding teaching,
small class sizes, hands-on and experiential learning, close
interaction with approachable faculty and staff, and opportunities
for undergraduates to conduct research with faculty. In addition,
through this advertised position and other efforts, the Department
is striving to create an inclusive and supportive community in
which all voices are valued and respected, diverse perspectives are
embraced, and students, faculty, and staff of all backgrounds and
identities can thrive.

For this position, we seek individuals with broad teaching and
scholarly interests in the area of environmental engineering and
who wish to cultivate and develop these interests with support and
mentoring. Candidates must have a doctorate in environmental
engineering, or a closely related engineering field, at the time of
appointment. Candidates are asked to convey in their application
materials an enthusiasm for undergraduate teaching, a commitment to
inclusive teaching practices in the classroom and laboratory, and
an interest in establishing a productive research program. We are
seeking an individual with teaching interests to support the EVEG
curriculum, as well as scholarly interests that complement our
current capabilities. This position is ideal for candidates who are
excited about working to enhance established strengths of the
University, examples of which include research involving
undergraduates, collaboration within and across departments and
colleges, community engagement, and others.

The successful candidate will spend one or two years as a Smith PTT
Fellow at Bucknell, bringing new perspectives and contemporary
knowledge and participating in campus life. The Fellow will receive
mentoring, a reduced teaching load, resources for scholarship,
travel, and professional development, and other support that will
help them a) better understand the nature of a career as a
teacher-scholar at a predominantly undergraduate institution; b)
develop and strengthen their pedagogical skills and experience; and
c) establish and enhance their research trajectory. The Fellow will
have the opportunity to engage in innovative teaching and
scholarship within our excellent facilities, including the
University's Environmental Engineering and Science Laboratory
(EESL). At the end of the fellowship period, and with positive
evaluations, the Fellow will transition into a tenure-track faculty
position at Bucknell.

Application materials must include the following five documents: 1)
a cover letter that clearly summarizes the candidate's interest in
Bucknell and in this position; 2) a current curriculum vitae; 3) a
teaching statement that conveys the candidate's interest in
undergraduate teaching, describes the candidate's ideas or
philosophy for equitable and inclusive teaching, and identifies the
courses within the EVEG curriculum to which the candidate could
contribute (3 pages maximum); 4) a scholarship statement addressing
the candidate's plans for scholarly work at Bucknell and how that
work may include undergraduates, if applicable (2 pages maximum);
and 5) contact information for at least three potential references
(letters may be requested by the search committee). Applications
will only be accepted online through Bucknell's career site
(careers.bucknell.edu). Review of applications is ongoing
and will continue until the position is filled.

Tenure-track Faculty Position in Environmental Engineering &
Science

University of Alberta

ENG Civil Engineering
Competition No. - A104149362
Closing Date - Will remain open until filled.

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering invites
applications for a full-time, tenure-track faculty position at the
Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor level in Environmental
Engineering and Science with a focus on air quality, particularly
related to 1) outdoor air quality and energy, 2) greenhouse gases
and climate change, 3) indoor air quality and
energy/bioaerosol/building material/ exposure.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate air pollution as
meteorological conditions become increasingly conducive to forming
air pollutants. These climate-driven changes will increase health
and economic implications. In addition, climate change will affect
air quality due to the increased frequency of extreme events such
as heatwaves and wildfires, which will affect the outdoor quality
and indoor air quality. Climate change can enhance the spread of
airborne pathogens. In cold climates, residences are tightly sealed
to increase energy efficiency and minimize heat loss. Such
conditions can negatively affect indoor air quality. This is
particularly important in the context of indoor pathogen
transmission (such as the SARS-COV-2 virus) and the build-up of
traditional and emerging air pollutants.

There is a need for interdisciplinary research to address the
interrelation of climate change, outdoor air quality, indoor air
quality, energy, and airborne pathogen transmission. Such research
directions are aligned with the department's focus on climate
change and the environment in the following strategic areas: 1)
sustainable energy, 2) climate change and the environment, 3)
resilient infrastructure.

We are seeking scholars that are motivated to join and collaborate
with our vibrant Environmental Engineering Group. Faculty members
in the group currently lead research efforts in green approaches to
water and wastewater treatment, solid waste management, bioenergy
and resource recovery from waste and wastewater, biomaterials for
environmental applications, environmental remediation,
ecotoxicology, and air pollution control.

The successful candidate will establish a recognized research
program and develop research partnerships with colleagues across
the University. They are expected to develop a vigorous
externally-funded research program, supervise graduate students and
teach graduate and undergraduate courses.

The successful candidate must have a PhD in environmental
Engineering, or in related fields and a record of publication in
reputable, peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. They
are expected to be or become a licensed Professional Engineer
through the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists
of Alberta (APEGA, https://www.apega.ca/). Licensure must
be obtained within five years from the date of hire..

About the University:

California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in 2002
as the newest campus in the California State University system.
Since that time, the University has grown and developed into one of
the premier public universities, not only in the California State
University system, but also in the nation. Indeed, U.S. News &
World Report listed CSUCI as 12th among “Top Public Universities in
the West” in the current edition of Best Colleges Rankings. In
2020, CollegeNET also ranked CSUCI 20th out of over 1,449 schools
in its “Social Mobility Index,” and Money Magazine rated CSUCI as
the 15th “Most Transformative College” in the nation.

CSUCI is a public comprehensive university that engages students in
critical inquiry and is dedicated to educating leaders for a global
society. The University is located in Ventura County and is home to
more than 5,470 undergraduate and 170 graduate students.
Approximately 55% of CSUCI's students are Pell Grant eligible, and
approximately 62% are first-generation college students. CSUCI is
also proud to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution
(HSI), with 55% of its undergraduate students self-identifying as
Hispanic/Latinx, 25% as White, 6% as Asian/Asian American, 4% as
multiracial, and 2% as Black/African American. In 2019, CSUCI was
awarded Excelencia in Education's inaugural “Seal of Excelencia”
for its facilitation of Latinx student success. Also, in 2022, CI
became the first college to earn the Seal of Excelencia
recertification.

CSUCI is committed to diversifying its faculty in order to address
students' ever-changing needs in the 21st century. The University
is also taking steps to confront racism and advocate for social
justice. To this end, CSUCI encourages applicants who are motivated
to serve and contribute to the university's tenure-track body,
which self-identifies as 62% White, 21% Hispanic/Latinx, 9%
Asian/Asian American, and 2% Black/African American.

Diversity Statement:

CSUCI is committed to recruiting individuals who are dedicated to
furthering inclusive excellence in our campus community. We seek to
enhance our diverse University population by welcoming people from
all backgrounds, and by working to sustain an environment where
colleagues can not only work and learn, but also create and
thrive.

CSUCI Mission Statement:

Placing students at the center of the educational experience,
California State University Channel Islands provides undergraduate
and graduate education that facilitates learning within and across
disciplines through integrative approaches, emphasizes experiential
and service learning, and graduates students with multicultural and
international perspectives.

CSUCI's Commitment to You:

CSUCI is committed to helping newly hired faculty develop a sense
of belonging in a collaborative and supportive community dedicated
to providing resources and opportunities for establishing and
sustaining a research agenda and engaging in continuous improvement
in equitable teaching and learning.

About the Program:

The mission of the Health Science Program at CSUCI is to prepare
future health professionals who are competent, compassionate,
creative, critical thinkers, to address health disparities in our
diverse communities. Our vision is to create a just and equitable
world of physically, mentally, and socially healthy people and
communities.

Our interdisciplinary degree program is designed to prepare
students for professional careers in private and public sectors
through rigorous training in health sciences. The curriculum
includes a set of core courses and several elective courses that
each student chooses from in consultation with an advisor.
