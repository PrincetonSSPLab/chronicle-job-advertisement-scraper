Department or Program Summary

The research and teaching of the UO Department of Indigenous, Race,
and Ethnic Studies examines the ways that race, as a system of
domination, is intimately tied to issues of gender, class,
sexuality, migration, indigeneity, and colonialism. With our
students, we interrogate historical and contemporary manifestations
of White supremacy and explain how systems of domination and acts
of resistance create and recreate racial subjects.

While IRES traditionally centers the social construction of race in
the United States, it also pays significant attention to
transnational migrations and diasporas resulting from the slave
trade, indentured labor, colonialism, imperialism, and
globalization.
Minimum Requirements

Ph.D. (by time of appointment)
Demonstrated teaching experience and expertise within the allied
fields of Indigenous, race, and ethnic studies are required.
Preferred Qualifications

Demonstrated excellence in relational, comparative, intersectional,
and transdisciplinary scholarship.
About the University

University of Oregon is located in Kalapuya ilihi, the homelands of
Kalapuyan peoples who were forcefully removed by the US government
in the 1850s. Their descendants today are predominantly citizens of
the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde and the Confederated
Tribes of Siletz Indians, and they maintain active ties to this
region and our campus. Like every state, Oregon has a history
replete with racism against people of color, as well as a history
of resistance and complications that we continue to work through
and teach about as we strive to create a better future.

The University of Oregon has a student population of 22,298
undergraduate and graduate students. Of these, 32% are students of
color. The university makes institutional commitments to diversity
and actively supports its goal with resources such as the Center
for Multicultural Academic Excellence, the Black Cultural Center,
the Many Nations Longhouse, the Center for Latino/a and Latin
American Studies, the Multicultural Center, and the Division of
Equity and Inclusion, among other initiatives.

Located 110 miles south of Portland, the Eugene-Springfield
metropolitan area (pop. 250,000) is in a region noted for its
dynamic quality of life and progressive cultural environment. We
are an hour's drive from the Pacific coast to the west and the

Position Announcement

The Department of Marketing in the Lundquist College of Business
seeks to fill three tenure-track faculty positions. Structurally,
two positions are intended for the assistant professor level and
one position at an advanced level (associate or full
professor).

The University of Oregon is supporting the Department of
Marketing's initiative to hire a cluster of scholars with aligned
research and teaching interests around the theme of “Marketing for
a Better World.” The marketing discipline is increasingly shifting
toward uncovering new ways marketing can address grand challenges
and be used for good, as represented by recent special issues in
premier marketing journals:

“Marketing has the power to improve lives, sustain livelihoods,
strengthen societies, and benefit the world at large.” —
Journal of Marketing's 2021 “Better Marketing for a Better World”
Special Issue.

“The grand challenges of climate change, widening inequalities
with respect to gender, race, and wealth, alongside current
healthcare, social, and economic crises are compelling
organizations to reimagine their marketing strategy to make a
meaningful contribution for a better world.” -- Journal of the
Academy of Marketing Science's announcement of its upcoming
“Reimagining Marketing Strategy: Driving the Debate on Grand
Challenges” Special Issue.

By adding three new faculty with scholarship, values, and interests
aligned to these topics and to the Department of Marketing's
existing faculty, the department hopes to grow a mutually
supportive community of scholars with overlapping values and sense
of purpose so that the department can better advance impactful
research and teaching. Ideally, the cluster hire will help the
department cover the full scope of marketing scholarship from
macro‐level to micro‐level, and includes the areas of modeling,
strategy and consumer behavior. This cluster hire aligns with the
University of Oregon Provost's Strategic Initiative on Environment
(https://environment.uoregon.edu/ihp‐criteria)
and Sport & Wellness (https://sportwellness.uoregon.edu/ihp‐criteria).
Department or Program Summary

The Department of Marketing (https://business.uoregon.edu/departments/marketing)
is one of five academic units that make up the Lundquist College of
Business (Lundquist), which is one of nine colleges and schools
within the University of Oregon (UO). The Lundquist College of

Position Announcement

The Department of Global Studies at the University of Oregon seeks
a full-time, tenure-track Assistant Professor in Global Political
Economy to start in Fall 2023. We seek a scholar who holds a Ph.D.
in a relevant social science, humanities, or interdisciplinary
program by the time of appointment and whose expertise addresses
one or more of these areas in qualitative and/or quantitative
perspective: economic globalization and its political and social
impacts; international political economic institutions and
processes; debt, dependency, and the legacies of colonization; and
the relationships between global political economy, human
development, and development strategies and policies. We are
especially interested in candidates who take critical,
interdisciplinary, and decolonial approaches to the global
political economy; and whose teaching and research complement core
foci in our department, including food systems, education, global
health and wellbeing, and environment and climate change. In their
application materials, candidates should address how their work
supports the diversity and equity goals of the department and the
university, should describe a robust research agenda, and should
demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in a language appropriate
for their regional specialization. We particularly welcome
applications from scholars who identify with populations
historically underrepresented in the academy and/or who have a
proven record of mentoring students from underrepresented
backgrounds.

The standard teaching load is five courses on the quarter system,
with course reductions usual for pre-tenure faculty. In addition to
teaching a core undergraduate course, Globalization and the Global
Economy, the successful candidate will develop other undergraduate
and graduate courses that explore political and economic
transformations and their consequences in global comparative and
regionally specific perspectives. Global Studies students bring a
rich array of backgrounds, identities and experiences to the
Department, including but not limited to international students,
first-generation students, Dreamers, differently abled and
non-traditional students and students from underrepresented ethnic
and gender identities. The successful candidate must therefore have
a demonstrated ability to work effectively and respectfully with
students, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds and a strong
record of professional activities that contribute to diversity,
equity, and inclusion.
Department or Program Summary

The Department of Global Studies thrives as an interdisciplinary
undergraduate and Master's program with connections across all
colleges and schools of the University of Oregon, and is a pivotal
component of the new School of Global Studies and Languages. We are
known for our curricular and research innovation and ethically
informed community engagement. Department faculty and students
conduct research fundamentally oriented toward intercultural
understanding from their differing social science perspectives.
Opportunities exist for research and teaching in connection with
the UO's regional research programs and centers, for example in
Latin American, African, and Asian Studies. New faculty are
supported through the UO's year-long professional development
program, access to the National Center for Faculty Development and
Diversity “bootcamp” program, and a structured departmental
mentorship.

Position Announcement

The Department of Education Studies (EDST) in the University of
Oregon's (UO) College of Education (COE) is seeking applications
for a tenure-line faculty position in Educational Data Science and
Quantitative Methods to primarily serve in its Quantitative
Research Methods in Education (QRME) Ph.D. program. The successful
candidate for this endowed Petrone Professorship will be an
accomplished, innovative researcher, leader, and educator at the
Associate or Full Professor level.

We are seeking a colleague with expertise in educational data
science and quantitative research methodology. The successful
candidate will teach courses in advanced quantitative research
methods and educational data science and will play a leadership
role in supporting a data science graduate specialization and
growing a master's degree in Educational Data Science. Applications
are encouraged from established, interdisciplinary scholars who are
nationally recognized as having an innovative and collaborative
approach to educational data science research and
instruction.

This position's primary instructional duties will be located in the
QRME PhD program. It will also include the opportunity to work in
the Education Policy Leadership, Critical and Sociocultural Studies
in Education, and other programs at the university depending on
candidate's experience, expertise, and interest. The QRME PhD
program develops researchers, scholars, and policy leaders who
engage in traditions of inquiry that create knowledge and
understanding founded in large-scale and quantitative empirical
evidence. The program focuses on building a strong understanding of
quantitative methods, studying causal and complex relationships
within applied educational, social, and institutional settings, and
using research to inform policy and practice in applied educational
and social settings. Linked to the QRME PhD are two popular
graduate specializations: one in quantitative research methods for
PhD students outside QRME and one in Data Science. These
specializations serve doctoral students across the COE and
UO.

Given that the field of data science is evolving and fluid, we
invite applicants from a broad set of methodological backgrounds at
the intersection of inferential statistics, research design,
computer science, domain knowledge, and a variety of philosophical
perspectives. The successful candidate will be committed to
engaging in critical interdisciplinary dialogues. Preference will
be given to candidates whose work focuses on data science
applications to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and social
justice in education. We are equally committed to increasing the
diversity of our faculty. Scholars from historically marginalized
backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. If you are uncertain
whether you meet the position requirements, we strongly encourage
you to apply or to contact us to discuss relevant transferrable
skills.

The position start date is September 16, 2023.

Position Announcement

The University of Oregon's Department of Linguistics invites
applications for a tenure-track position of Assistant Professor in
Linguistics, to begin in fall 2023. We seek candidates specializing
in language description based on primary data collection, with
training and research orientation that will further our
department's commitment to functional/usage-based approaches to
linguistic explanation. We particularly welcome applications from
scholars who are members of Indigenous language communities or from
other populations historically underrepresented in the academy,
and/or whose life experience would contribute unique perspectives.
Similarly, we seek applicants who will contribute to excellence in
teaching students from diverse backgrounds at the undergraduate and
graduate levels.
Department or Program Summary

We are a growing department structured in its research and graduate
program around 3 broad themes: linguistic diversity & society;
language learning & technology; and language processing &
human health. We share a usage-based approach to understanding
language patterns, with strengths in functionalist approaches to
syntax, language description and revitalization, historical
linguistics, experimental linguistics, laboratory phonology,
language acquisition and teaching, and variationist
sociolinguistics. Most Ph.D. dissertation research at the
University of Oregon is in either language documentation (usually
describing languages not previously documented), experimental
research (including laboratory phonology, discourse studies,
gesture, and semantics), second language acquisition and teaching,
and, increasingly, language revitalization as a research endeavor.
See more at: https://linguistics.uoregon.edu/.
We are committed to principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Our racial justice statement and diversity action plan can be
consulted at https://linguistics.uoregon.edu/diversity-and-inclusion.

appointment.
Candidates must show strong promise of excellence in teaching
as well as research.
They should also demonstrate a commitment to academic
excellence and to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Preferred Qualifications

Research: A successful candidate will have an established
program of field research on an under-described language or
language family, and will possess thorough knowledge of relevant
technology and software. We are open to specializations in any
subfield that is related to the analysis of morphosyntax and
semantics. We especially welcome candidates who specialize in the
analysis of language in use, broadly conceived. This can include
working on linguistic anthropology, discourse analysis, information
structure, small-corpus analysis, or any related topic. We are also
interested in scholars who will enhance the department's existing
strengths in historical linguistics, usage-based approaches to
syntax, laboratory phonology, applied linguistics, and language
revitalization, and/or who will complement our current expertise
with other strengths such as experimental and/or computational
approaches in fieldwork. The best applications will also highlight
the theoretical richness, typological relevance, or social
relevance of their research program in one or more areas of
linguistics.
Teaching: Experience in or demonstrated commitment to
undergraduate teaching. Candidates are asked to discuss their
approach to mentoring graduate students.

About the University

The University of Oregon has a long tradition of environmental
research and activism and is nationally known for our
interdisciplinary study of the environment. Environmental justice
in the U.S. has been a core concern of scholarship in environmental
studies, and this hire promises to add to the UO's expertise and to
expand our departmental focus. UO is also one of a shrinking number
of universities committed to teaching about racial, gender and
LGBTQ justice. Our university requires students to take courses
that focus on power and inequality. Our Provost has dedicated
university resources to advancing programs that support faculty who
teach these courses through awards, fellowships and mentorship. We
are especially interested in candidates, therefore, who can support
this work in mentoring, research, teaching, and outreach with
women, first-generation students, communities of color, and other
underrepresented groups. We encourage applications from all
qualified candidates, and strongly encourage women, faculty of
color, LGBTQIA faculty and faculty with disabilities to apply. All
applicants are requested to include in their cover letter
information about how they will contribute to this work.

members of the Association of American Universities and holds the
