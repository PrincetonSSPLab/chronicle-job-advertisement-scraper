include the signed authorization with the application materials,
the application will be considered incomplete, and as with any

Although all applicants for faculty recruitments must complete the
entire application, only finalists considered for Academic Senate
Assistant Professor or Lecturer with Potential for Security of
Employment, Steps 4, 5, or 6, or Acting Professor of Law positions

Open August 30, 2022 through Friday, Oct 14, 2022 at 11:59pm
(Pacific Time)

Position description
The Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) seeks applicants for a
tenure-track, Assistant Professor position as part of the
University of California, Berkeley's Cluster search in “Anti-Black
Racism and Social Inclusion (ARSI)."" The multi-year Initiative
recognizes the need to strengthen democratic structures that are
currently in crisis (e.g., through the suppression of voting
rights; hyper-criminalization; persistent wealth inequality; highly
segregated neighborhoods and schools, and approaches to crime
control), and includes the Department of African American Studies,
Department of Sociology, the Law School, the School of Public
Health, the School of Social Welfare, and GSPP. The specific
language of the Cluster initiative is presented in greater detail
below.

As a leading public university located in the socially, culturally,
and economically dynamic Bay Area, UC Berkeley is positioned to
lead the reimagining of our democratic institutions and the
building of a more just society. In line with the larger ARSI
Cluster goals, the GSPP faculty member will focus on the systems
and structures that delimit Black lives and engage in scholarship,
professional practice, and collaborative service to investigate how
anti-blackness functions as a central organizing feature of US
social political institutions.

GSPP seeks applicants whose primary research focus pertains to how
anti-blackness inhibits racial justice and drives inequality in any
policy domain, including but not limited to criminal justice and
public safety, law, education, housing policy, labor market policy,
democracy (e.g., voting and elections, speech and expression),
population statistics, international conflict, and health policy.
We welcome empirically-oriented social scientists and data
scientists with interdisciplinary expertise in critical
epistemologies, like critical race theory, and the Black
intellectual and Black feminist traditions.

Candidates should have a demonstrated track-record of independent
or collaborative research excellence, aspirations to teach and be
actively engaged in a professional graduate school setting, and a
commitment to interdisciplinary perspectives and collegial
service.

The successful applicant's faculty line would rest within the
Goldman School. The faculty member would also join a dynamic cohort
of junior faculty across academic units who together will connect
and amplify campus networks on antiracist scholarship and social
transformation. The cluster structure will provide greater support
and cross-disciplinary synergistic opportunities intended to foster
the success and career development of faculty hired into the
cluster on the UC Berkeley campus.

The Goldman School of Public Policy is committed to addressing the
family needs of faculty, including dual career couples and single
parents. We are also interested in candidates who have had
non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family
reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside
academia. For information about potential relocation to Berkeley,
or career needs of accompanying partners and spouses, please visit:
http://ofew.berkeley.edu/new-faculty

Candidates must demonstrate a commitment to advancing diversity,
equity, inclusion, and belonging through their research, teaching,
and/or service. UC Berkeley is committed to upholding the
university's principles of community so that every individual can
be successful in a healthy, welcoming, and safe environment.
Additional information about programs and resources supporting the
advancement of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is

Description of the University of California, Berkeley Anti-Black
Racism and Social Inclusion Cluster

UC Berkeley is committed to building a community of scholars whose
work contributes to contemporary efforts to strengthen democratic
structures that are currently in crisis (e.g., through the
suppression of voting rights; hyper-criminalization; persistent
wealth inequality; highly segregated schools, and approaches to
crime control). The Anti-Black Racism and Social Inclusion hiring
initiative centers anti-blackness as a central organizing feature
of social and political institutions in the US and globally, and as
an expansive conceptual framework that draws attention to the
systems and structures that delimit Black lives and enables us to
interrogate how anti-blackness functions across and within
racial/ethnic groups. We seek scholars who are leading or emerging
voices in conversations on anti-blackness as it relates to outcomes
in various social domains and who possess a demonstrated commitment
to advancing anti-racism both inside and outside the academy,
whether in the United States or internationally.

This initiative is especially interested in applicants whose
research can contribute to theoretical, conceptual, and empirical
understandings of how social institutions can provide for the
safety and well-being of a diverse group of people in a democratic
society as it reckons with its roots in racism, anti-blackness and
white supremacy. We invite applicants with interdisciplinary
expertise in critical epistemologies, like critical race theory,
and the Black intellectual and Black feminist traditions. We also
invite applicants whose scholarly experience includes a
demonstrated commitment to this research arc and to
teaching/mentoring, service, practice and public intellectualism
/partnerships along these lines.

Primary Duties, Responsibilities, and Tasks:

Primary responsibilities for this position include teaching Scene
Study and Advanced Acting courses to our BFA Theatre and
Performance and BFA Acting students. Our ideal candidate is
Stanislavsky driven and informed, but with an anti-racist and
inclusive lens. Candidates whose approaches include other
traditions or methods are also encouraged to apply. Directing
productions for Emerson Stage - the producing organization for the
Department of Performing Arts - is also a requirement of this

representation, privilege-based difference, and inclusive
excellence continues to evolve.

film to expose power relationships and oppressive practices that

sexuality, and class dynamics through their work. Candidates must

students, and staff from diverse backgrounds. An ability to work
and teach collaboratively, and a strong commitment to undergraduate
education beyond the classroom are essential. Members of

The successful candidate will conduct multidisciplinary research studies in collaboration with health care providers and community organizations with a focus on social, behavioral, and psychological factors impacting the health and wellness of communities, especially underserved and/or marginalized communities.

We intend to build a team of scholars with expertise in both community-based participatory research and health technology in order to collaborate with communities to develop and apply health technologies that will reduce health disparities.

The distinctive experiences of undergraduates and graduate students in the COH include an innovative curriculum, robust experiential learning opportunities, and integrated career and professional development. The COH is host to three research institutes: the Institute for Indigenous Studies, the Institute for Health Policy and Politics, and the Children’s Environmental Precision Health Institute.

CSULB seeks to recruit faculty who enthusiastically support the
University's strong commitment to the academic success of all of
our students, including students of color, students with
disabilities, students who are first generation to college,
veterans, students with diverse socio-economic backgrounds, and
students of diverse sexual orientations and gender expressions and
identities. CSULB seeks to recruit and retain a diverse workforce
as a reflection of our commitment to serve the People of
California, to maintain the excellence of the University, and to
offer our students a rich variety of expertise, perspectives, and
ways of knowing and learning.

The School of Social Work is proud to be an integral part of a
university that is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution and
an Asian American and Native Pacific Islander Serving Institution
located in a city with a large Cambodian/Cambodian American
population in an aspirational context for increasing Black,
Indigenous and People of Color enrollment. The mission of the
School of Social Work is to educate and graduate diverse, ethical,
competent social work students able to think critically and use
evidence-based practice approaches to effectively serve culturally
diverse, vulnerable individuals, families and communities in a wide
variety of practice areas as practitioners, leaders and social
justice advocates.

Over the past 20 years, our Social Work faculty has assumed
leadership in attracting over $94 million dollars in extramural
funds and secured almost $21 million on behalf of local Long Beach
human services, community organizations and education settings. Our
curriculum prepares graduate students in three specialization
areas: child and family well-being, integrated health, and
adulthood and aging.

The School engages in collaborative, community-based research that
enhances the well-being of vulnerable populations and disadvantaged
communities. The School also engages students at both the bachelor
and graduate levels in curricula that recognizes the importance of
identifying that power and privilege can be a resource. Identifying
and recognizing how power and privilege can be leveraged as a
resource is important to advocate for and/or empower those who may
not have similar power and/or privilege. Our School hopes to
improve service delivery systems and contribute to social work
knowledge. Our School also provides service to the community and
the profession through the development of ongoing relationships
with various groups. Those include grassroots community leaders,
community-based non-profit organizations, governmental
organizations, and foundations.

DEPARTMENT PROFILE
The Department of Visual Communication Design (VCD) galvanizes students to be original, critical, empathetic and vital. Our students represent a diverse collection of interests, skills and cultures, united by a common goal: to explore and experiment, engage and excite, and ultimately advance whatever purpose they choose to pursue through the power of visual and verbal communication.
We prepare our students for a life in design by guiding them along a pathway that is both rooted and radical in its structure and trajectory. We provide a critically-based design education through an understanding of social implications; cultural and historical roles of design; the creation of meaningful, creative, and informative visual forms and messages to diverse audiences; and the exploration and application of a range of technologies, methodologies, and theories to target, develop and assess interactions and experiences. This happens at every level of the curriculum, from the overall framework to individual courses, activities and outcomes. This distinctive approach is made more potent within the context of a legendary, multi-disciplinary art school aligned with one of the most highly regarded art museums in the world.
Further information about the department can be found at https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/visual-communication-design
RESPONSIBILITIES
Full-time faculty in VCD teach and advise undergraduate and graduate students within the interdisciplinary art and design school environment of SAIC. Faculty impart to their students a progressive awareness of the changing and interrelated roles of representations, objects, environments, interactions, and media; maintain an active and recognized professional practice of client-initiated or self-initiated design development and/or academic research investigations; and participate in the SAIC community through ongoing curricular development, and department and school governance    
QUALIFICATIONS
A terminal degree in visual communication/graphic design or other relevant field of study is preferred.  Teaching experience at the university level is highly preferred. In particular, we invite applications from candidates with expertise in User Interface (UI) design, hybrid practices, and/or storytelling. Areas of research, practice, and teaching may include design for diverse content structures (narrative, informational, or interpretive), interaction modes (digitally- or physically-interactive), and content formats (screens, pages, objects, or environments). We seek candidates with the knowledge and aptitude to teach and mentor students from diverse backgrounds, and who will create a positive, inventive, and productively critical learning environment. The ideal candidate will contribute to the diversity of the School by bringing a perspective, way of thinking, and/or a unique set of experiences that expand the intellectual conversations and design practices in the field.

Salary is competitive with peer institutions and commensurate with level of practice, scholarship and current academic research, extent of teaching experience, and current professional standing.
DEPARTMENT PROFILE
​​The Department of Arts Administration and Policy at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago is structured around values that are central to the field of Arts Administration: collaboration both within and outside the sector, creative leadership, critical thinking, civic engagement, active and prioritized engagement with advancing equity in the arts, and reflection and action on ways in which the arts might advance social justice. The department embraces the interdisciplinary, experimental core of SAIC through integrated curriculum design, the merging of theory and practice, the development of new modalities and partnerships, and the combining of idealistic, inventive values grounded in practical skills. Our program insists on an understanding of the arts in the larger social context, leveraging the immediacy of an art school environment and building diverse connections across Chicago and beyond.
We see arts administrators not as mere conduits through which art must pass between artist and audience, but rather as those professionals who are charged and entrusted with shaping, maintaining, re-envisioning, and revolutionizing the very platforms and organizational mechanisms through which arts-inspired conversation and change can occur. As such, they must be responsive, dialogic problem-solvers and re-imaginers whose work with art and artists is, by nature, mutually creative.
Our students are curious, self-directed, and socially-engaged emerging professionals. A typical graduate cohort ranges from 18-24 students, hailing from across the US and internationally.
Further information about the department can be found at: https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/arts-administration-and-policy
RESPONSIBILITIES
Full-time faculty in the Department of Arts Administration and Policy teach and advise undergraduate and graduate students within the interdisciplinary art and design school environment of SAIC. We seek candidates either from arts administration or from tangent disciplines and practices who will help us advance that work, and continue the process of envisioning what a curriculum focused in this way might look like.
Depending on their particular area(s) of expertise and experience, the successful candidate will teach graduate-level classes in some of the following areas:

Leadership and management (see our Management Studio model for information on how this is structured in the department)
Cultural policy studies, especially in a global context
Digital practices in arts administration
Urban studies and planning; or, community development practices, as they connect with cultural activity
Social justice and equity work in and through the arts and culture

There may also be opportunities to develop elective offerings, at either the undergraduate or graduate level, in another of the candidate’s areas of expertise.
Full-time faculty participate in the SAIC community through ongoing curricular development, departmental administration, and school governance.
QUALIFICATIONS
The successful candidate will hold a terminal degree or have tested experience in arts administration, or a related discipline. Previous college teaching experience is preferred. Preference will be given to candidates with primary expertise in management, and supplementary expertise in research and critical studies. The ideal candidate will contribute to the diversity of the School by bringing a perspective, way of thinking, and/or a unique set of experiences that expand the intellectual conversations and practices in the field. Diversity, equity, and inclusion lie at the heart of our practice: we, therefore, seek candidates with the knowledge and aptitude to teach and mentor students from diverse backgrounds.

One of the largest studio programs at SAIC, the Department of FVNMA has ten tenured faculty members and more than twenty-five part-time faculty members with a very broad range of expertise.
Closely associated with FVNMA are several significant organizations and programs. Conversations at the Edge (CATE), a series founded by FVNMA in 2001 and held at the Gene Siskel Film Center, is a major meeting place in Chicago for the international media arts community. The Video Data Bank (VDB), one of the leading resources in the United States for videotapes by and about contemporary artists, is located on campus, where it maintains both analog and digital archives, actively engages in the preservation of video art works, commissions critical texts that contextualize artists’ work, and oversees the publication of curated programs and artists’ monographs. The Gene Siskel Film Center is one of the country’s premiere screening venues dedicated to festival series that celebrate diverse voices and international cultures. The Gene Siskel Film Center also premieres trailblazing work by independent filmmakers, restores and revives essential films from cinema history, and hosts insightful, provocative discussions with filmmakers and media artists. In addition, The Art Institute of Chicago’s Stone Gallery, housed within the museum’s Modern Wing, showcases a world-class collection of film, video, and new media works by an international array of contemporary artists.

The successful candidate will be an interdisciplinary environmental

The candidate will have earned a Ph.D. in geography; environmental

related field by the time of appointment. In addition, the
successful candidate will demonstrate expertise with (1) geographic
information systems (GIS) and related spatial and quantitative
analyses tools, and (2) community-centered, participatory,
feminist, and/or justice-oriented research.

The teaching load at Bucknell University is five courses per year.
The person hired into this position will be expected to:

● Teach core requirements in both Geography and Environmental
Studies and Sciences on a rotating basis (such as ENST 411:
Community Projects and GEOG 204: Spatial Methods and Geographic
Information Systems); and

● Develop additional courses in their area of specialization as
electives for both majors (such as ”Geographies of Environmental
Health and Climate Change”)

The candidate's courses may also contribute to the broader goals of
the College of Arts and Sciences, including the core curricular
requirement “Nature, People, and Justice.”

We seek an outstanding faculty member with clear evidence of
commitment to undergraduate teaching and research, student
learning, collaboration, and interdisciplinarity. We believe that
students learn best in a diverse, inclusive community and we are
therefore committed to Bucknell's efforts to create a climate that

underrepresented in higher education.

Applications should include 1) a Cover Letter; 2) a Curriculum
Vitae; 3) a teaching statement, including discussion of potential
courses for this position; and 4) a statement describing any
experience, training, service, or engagement with issues of

Position description
The Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California,
Berkeley invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position
in Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies at the rank of
assistant, associate, or full professor. We encourage applications
from scholars in any humanistic discipline, especially those who
employ literary, media, digital media, and/or cultural studies
methodologies and take intersectional and interdisciplinary
approaches to research and teaching. Potential areas of expertise
include, but are not limited to, Asian American and/or Asian
diaspora literatures, global Asia cultural studies, transpacific
and/or hemispheric cultural and media studies, and new media
studies.

The successful applicant will be expected to maintain an active
research agenda, teach introductory, upper- division, and graduate
courses, and undertake service to the department, campus, and
university.

The Department of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley is committed to the
comparative study of racialization and indigeneity within the
Americas, as well as between the U.S. and other nations. We seek to
understand race and racism as “moving targets” that undergo
mutations or evolve, and to recognize the complexities of the
intersections of race with gender, class, sexuality, religion, and
other systems of difference and axes of power. Our approaches to
these issues interrogate the relationship of social structure to
those of literary and cultural practices, and in so doing question
and challenge traditional disciplinary boundaries and assumptions.
In addition to grounding our scholarly work in the concrete
situations of people of color, we also use a methodological framing
that emphasizes both the structural dimensions of race and racism
(social, political, and economic inequalities and struggles against
them) and the associated cultural dimensions (literary, artistic,
musical and other forms of humanistic expression). Our scholarly
concerns are explicitly linked to the development of critical
knowledges and are informed by a commitment to social change and
decolonization.

In the Department of Ethnic Studies and the Division of Social
Sciences, we recognize the intrinsic relationship between diversity
and excellence in all our endeavors and embrace open and equitable
access to opportunities for learning and development as our
obligation and goal. We seek candidates who demonstrate a
commitment to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging
through their research, teaching, and/or service. Read our DEIB
statement from the Faculty of Ethnic Studies at the following
Website: https://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/about/mission/

advancement of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is

Our Department is committed to upholding the university's
principles of community so that every individual can be successful
in a healthy, welcoming, and safe environment. We are committed to
addressing the family needs of faculty, including dual career
couples and single parents. We are also interested in individuals
who have had nontraditional career paths, who have taken time off
for personal reasons (e.g., caretaking or disability), or who have
achieved excellence in careers outside academe (e.g., in the arts,
community organizing, or professional service). For information
about potential relocation to Berkeley, or career needs of
accompanying partners and spouses, please visit: http://ofew.berkeley.edu/new-faculty

Considering the significant disruptions caused by the Covid-19
pandemic, particularly for disadvantaged groups, in our evaluation
of applicants, dips in productivity in otherwise strong records
occurring with the onset of the pandemic will be evaluated with the
context of the pandemic in mind.

Social Welfare Assistant/Associate Professor with Expertise in
Latinx Communities and Social Welfare
University of California Los Angeles


Requisition Number: JPF07738


The University of California, Los Angeles, Department of Social
Welfare seeks applicants for a faculty position as an
Assistant/Associate Professor in the area of scholarship and
research on the Latinx/Latino/a experience. UCLA's commitment to
the Latino/a population is reflected in its effort to achieve
designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and which
includes multiple faculty positions throughout its campus to ensure
that research, teaching and public service are serving the Latinx
population. UCLA's HSI Infrastructure Initiative provides resources
for students, post-doctoral scholars, staff and research programs
as well as additional faculty lines.

UCLA aims to achieve federal designation as a Hispanic Serving
Research Institution (HSI) by 2025. In preparation for this
designation, the Office of the Chancellor and the Executive Vice
Chancellor and Provost have sponsored this search in order to
recruit exceptional scholars whose teaching, scholarship and/or
mentoring has strong ties to the Latinx experiences in the United
States. This search is conducted in partnership between the Chicano
Studies Research Center (CSRC) and the Department of Social
Welfare. Faculty hired through this search are expected to maintain
an active affiliation to the CSRC and encourage the success of
Latinx and first-generation scholars.

In participating in this initiative, the Department of Social
Welfare in the Luskin School of Public Affairs seeks to hire an
Assistant or Associate professor who studies the social, behavioral
and mental health issues confronting Latino/a families and
communities. We seek applicants who address the demographic, social
and policy issues facing what will be the nation's largest
ethnic/minority population. We are looking to hire a scholar who
focuses on social welfare related concerns in clinical, practice
and/or policy areas around the broad issues of immigration, mental
health, child welfare, gerontology and the broader civic engagement
and empowerment potential of Latinx communities in the US and
globally. We encourage applications as well from individuals
conducting research across diverse facets of the Latinx communities
including research with indigenous populations and Afro/Latinx
communities.

Successful applicants are expected to develop a nationally
recognized program and collaborate across disciplines to develop
research initiatives promoting research and leadership for the
emerging Latino/a communities. Candidates should demonstrate
evidence of strong research productivity, potential for securing
extramural funding and a commitment to excellence in teaching,
practice and mentoring of graduate students. Applicants must have
an MSW at the time of application, and a PhD in social welfare or a
related field at the time of appointment, and demonstrate a robust
research agenda with relevance to social welfare systems,
practices, and policies. We are also interested in candidates with
clinical and social work experiences that complement the
Departments strengths in scholarship, field placements and
professional practice. Candidates must also demonstrate commitment
to multi-disciplinary collaboration among the Luskin School's
departments (Social Welfare, Urban Planning, Public Policy) and
with the University's Latinx centers (Chicano Studies Research
Center, Latino Policy and Politics Institute, Cesar E. Chavez
Department of Chicano/a and Central American Studies).

UCLA is among the leading global universities and is the number one
ranked public university in the nation, and the UCLA Department of
Social Welfare is ranked among the top ten Social Welfare programs
nationally. We educate PhD and MSW students along three main areas
of concentration: Child and Family Well Being, Health and Mental
Health Across the Life Span, and Social and Economic Justice. Our
faculty also teach in the school-wide undergraduate program in
Public Affairs. Los Angeles is a global city renowned for its
dynamism, rich cultural diversity, and spectacular climate.

The Position is opened until filled, but early applications are
encouraged. Applications will be reviewed beginning Oct 1, 2022.
Interested candidates should apply through UC Recruit: https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/JPF07738. Please submit
a cover letter that illustrates your leadership experience; a
curriculum vitae, brief summaries of your research and teaching;
one to two publications or works in progress, a statement of
equity, diversity and inclusion; and the names and affiliations of
three references. References will only be contacted for candidates
who advance as a top finalist.

The University of California is committed to creating and
maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application,
and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through
academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in
University programs and activities can work and learn together in a
safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment, bullying
and other demeaning behavior, discrimination, exploitation, or
intimidation. With this commitment as well as a commitment to
addressing all forms of academic misconduct, UCLA conducts targeted
employment reference checks for finalists to whom departments or
other hiring units would like to extend formal offers of
appointment into Academic Senate faculty positions. The targeted
employment reference checks involve contacting the finalists'
current and prior places of employment to ask whether there have
been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the
University's Faculty Code of Conduct. To implement this process,
UCLA requires all applicants for Academic Senate faculty positions
to complete, sign, and upload the form entitled “Authorization to
Release Information” into RECRUIT as part of their application. If
the applicant does not include the signed authorization to release
information with the application materials, the application will be
considered incomplete. As with any incomplete application, the
application will not receive further consideration. Although all
applicants for faculty recruitments must complete the entire
application, only finalists (i.e., those to whom the department or
other hiring unit would like to extend a formal offer) considered
for Academic Senate faculty positions will be subject to targeted
employment reference checks.

As an institution committed to antiracism, we are action-oriented and intentional in dismantling every systemic barrier that prevents Black and Brown student excellence and liberation.  

As Pierce College deepens its commitment to racial equity, it is of the highest priority that we focus our tenure-track faculty hiring process to seek faculty with the expertise to lead our institution in serving Black and Brown students.
