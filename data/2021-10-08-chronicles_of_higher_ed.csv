infrastructure systems, such as transportation, water, energy, and
waste, are implicated in complex ways with human activities, health
and well-being, the nature of disease, historically-rooted
inequities, and the impacts of a changing climate. Devices and
flows of information commonly associated with smart cities are
increasingly fortifying research at this intersection of human
health, urban form, and the environment, with the empirical rigor
and exploratory possibility of data science. The successful
applicant will help expand UW’s substantial expertise in these
interrelated fields of research and data science.
 Responsibilities
This new faculty member will play a key role in elevating the
research and teaching programs of UDP, DEOHS, and the

About the Position
The successful applicant will receive a primary tenure

Department of Environment and Occupational Health Sciences in the
School of Public Health and will be a member of the Data Science
minor program, at the UW Seattle Campus. The position is full time
with a 9 month service period. The division of time among these
programs will be determined in discussion between the successful
applicant and the leaders of these programs.

These departments lead interdisciplinary PhD programs and
concurrent Master's degree programs. The concurrent Master of
Public Health and Master of Urban Planning degree program (https://deohs.washington.edu/graduate-certificates-and-concurrent-degrees)
trains students to work across multiple disciplines including the
built environment and public health. The PhD in Urban Design and
Planning at the University of Washington (https://sites.uw.edu/urbdpphd/)
is one of thirty-nine PhD programs in urban and regional planning
in North America. Faculty affiliated with this interdisciplinary
program are drawn from Urban Design and Planning and 20 other
disciplines across the University, including Environmental and
Occupational Health Sciences. 
 
The University of Washington is one of the world’s preeminent
public universities in impact and funding, a testament to its
culture of collaboration and the quality of its faculty, students,

they are likely to make to research in the future.

Olin College, located outside Boston, was founded in 1997 with a
mission to develop students as exemplary engineers, to drive
positive change in engineering education, and to do good in the
world. In this short amount of time, Olin College has become
recognized as a leader in engineering education: Olin’s graduates
are recognized for their creativity, initiative, and ability to
make a difference, and Olin collaborates with other institutions
and individuals around the world to change engineering education.
Now we are starting a new chapter. Today, we have a new president,
Dr. Gilda Barabino, and a new vision that centers on achieving
equity both within and through engineering. Would you like to join
us in shaping Olin’s next chapter?
ENGINEERING
Olin defines engineering broadly, from understanding people and
their needs, to designing solutions, to creating new technologies
and services to benefit people and society. Our approach to
engineering education erases boundaries between disciplines,
encourages students to take control of their learning, and
emphasizes human-centered design and entrepreneurship. There are no
departments at Olin—rather, we work together to co-design
experimental, experiential, student-centric learning opportunities,
and we thrive on involving students in our research, consulting,
and other forms of professional work. 
IS FOR EVERYONE.
We believe engineering education must be accessible and
welcoming for people from all backgrounds, and that engineering
should serve not only individuals but also society and the planet.
Today engineering education fails to address the systemic
challenges that exclude so many promising young people from the
engineering profession. Today engineers too often ask “How can we
design it?” before asking “Should we design it?” These failures
perpetuate deep inequities, and addressing them will require
questioning how we teach and how we do engineering, as well as who
is included in these conversations. This won’t be easy. It will
require collaboration, humility, and diverse ways of thinking; it
also will require a willingness to take risks and think big. 
And that’s why we’re excited to embrace this challenge. 
JOIN US.
Are you passionate about equity and access? Do you want to join
us in reframing who can be engineers and what counts as
engineering? Do you want to mentor students to better integrate
engineering and other fields as they study and tackle complex
technical systems and societal challenges? Come join our
team. We are looking for individuals (at all ranks) with
expertise and experience in engineering (all disciplines) and/or
adjacent fields (e.g., applied mathematics, computer science,
applied physics). Olin is committed to becoming an increasingly
inclusive and diverse learning community that supports equitable
learning opportunities for everyone, and we strongly encourage
women and individuals from historically underrepresented
communities to apply. 
We plan to hold a number of virtual events in October and
November at which you can connect with Olin faculty and get to know
more about our community. If you would be interested in attending
any of these events, we invite you to provide us with your email
address in 
this form. 
Please visit https://www.olin.edu/join-community/faculty/
to apply. We will review applicant materials as they are received.
If we find a potential match, we may contact you to request
additional materials. First consideration will be given to
applications received by December 1, 2021, but applications will be
considered until the position is filled. For questions, please
contact faculty.search@olin.edu. We look forward to hearing from
you!

Position Description


The Department of Film and Digital Media at the University of
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for an Assistant
Professor of Indigenous Media, Cultural Sovereignty and
Decolonization.

The Film & Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz offers an
undergraduate major that currently enrolls 700 students, the
two-year MFA program in Social Documentation that averages eight
students per cohort, and a PhD program currently enrolling 29
students. Our curriculum reflects an understanding that
intellectual and creative work are related forms of production and
inquiry that challenge the traditionally conceived borders between
creative and critical practice. The Arts Division, of which Film
& Digital Media is a part, supports faculty research through
the Arts Research Institute http://artsresearch.ucsc.edu/ari/; the campus
supports research and teaching with grants awarded by the Committee
on Research, the Committee on Teaching, and other groups. An
Indigenous Networking Group actively works to serve the common
interests of and support Native/Indigenous faculty members from
different departments across the UCSC campus. UC Santa Cruz is a
Hispanic-Serving Institution with a high proportion of
first-in-family undergraduate students.

We seek to hire a colleague whose creative work and/or scholarship
embodies or addresses emerging and/or historical Indigenous/Native
media practices. Candidates might be a mediamaker and/or a
theorist-practitioner. Mediamakers will be working with audiovisual
systems of meaning that are centered in Indigenous/Native
communities and expression. Theorist-practitioners might emphasize
ethical, social and cultural considerations of Indigenous
knowledge, sovereignty and decolonization theories, methods and
practices. Ideal candidates will demonstrate a commitment to
community involvement and an Indigenous lived experience including
working with Native American, First Nations, Inuit or Métis
communities and organizations in Turtle Island; or more broadly the
Americas, the Pacific Rim, Borderlands or Circumpolar Indigenous
Nations. We are interested in located knowledges and practices but
also collaborative or comparative approaches across geographically
diverse areas.

We welcome Indigenous/Native pedagogical and practical approaches
to media production and theory as an opportunity to strengthen the
breadth of both critical research and production methods and
perspectives taught and supported in the department at the
undergraduate, graduate and faculty levels. Such a position would
be supported by our departmental commitment to an ongoing process
of developing structures and practices for centering social justice
in teaching and research, and would enrich ongoing collaborations
with other programs such as: the new MFA in Environmental Art and
Social Practice in the Art Department, the Digital Arts and New
Media MFA Program, Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, Feminist
Studies, History of Art and Visual Culture, Latin American and
Latino Studies, Literature, Sociology, History of Consciousness,
the Science and Justice Research Center, the Center for the Middle
East and North Africa, Center for Creative Ecologies, Center for
Documentary Arts and Research, and/or the Center for South Asian
Studies.

Candidates should have either a terminal degree (PhD or MFA) or at
least six years of demonstrated evidence of creative work and/or
scholarship relevant to the areas described above. We welcome
candidates whose experiences in Indigenous communities and/or
community organizations inform their approach to teaching,
research/creative production, and service. Strong consideration
will be given, as appropriate, to creative work, research, teaching
record and the willingness to participate in the ongoing curricular
development, diversification and decolonization of our department's
program. We would expect candidates to prioritize their own
creative and/or scholarly work, to pursue a program of research or
creative production, and to contribute to our general curriculum.
The campus operates on a schedule of three 11-week quarters per
academic year. In accordance with the department's workload policy,
faculty members are required to offer the equivalent of 4 five-unit
courses per year. Additional duties include advising and mentoring
both undergraduate and graduate students, participating in faculty
governance at the departmental and campus level, and actively
undertaking administrative service for the department, affiliated
college, and University. The ability to contribute significantly to
graduate education and the mentoring of graduate students is highly
desirable.

Our first round of review will be solely based on (1) the statement
of creative practice and research and (2) the statement of
contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion. We welcome
candidates who understand the barriers facing historically
oppressed groups in higher education, and who have engaged in
teaching, research, professional and/or public service
contributions that promote equity, justice, and antiracist,
decolonial practice. We are looking for candidates that demonstrate
effective strategies that support the recruitment and success of
underrepresented scholars and students, which may take a variety of
forms. The rubric that we will use to evaluate the statement of
contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion is available here:
https://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/communications/docs/ucsc-rubrics-c2deistatements.pdf.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidate cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

University of California Santa Cruz is located on the unceded
territory of the Awaswas-speaking Uypi Tribe. The Amah Mutsun
Tribal Band, comprised of the descendants of Indigenous people
taken to missions Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during Spanish
colonization of the Central Coast, is today working hard to restore
traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from
historical trauma.

The School of Global Public Health (GPH) of New York University
(NYU) is seeking applications for tenure-track Associate Professor
in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS). 
Exceptional candidates at the advanced Assistant Professor rank
will be considered.  GPH seeks candidates of outstanding
potential and scholarship who can contribute to the academic and
research enterprise in NYC.  NYU is home to the Global Network
University with various campuses and study-away sites (3 portal
campuses and 12 global academic centers in Africa, South America,
North America, China, Australia, Europe, and the Middle
East).  This unique arrangement enables GPH faculty to
establish training and degree programs and research efforts
worldwide; offers faculty and students truly unique opportunities
to engage in their research and study around the world; and informs
public health practice both locally and globally through the
exchange of knowledge.
GPH offers academic programs at the undergraduate, masters and
doctoral levels. The undergraduate program includes 13 joint majors
where students study public health with other relevant subjects.
The CEPH-accredited Master of Public Health degree allows students
to obtain an MPH in one of nine concentrations, and the PhD in
Public Health is offered in one of four areas of study –
Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Social & Behavioral Sciences, and
Public Health Policy & Management.  In addition, a new
school-wide, interdisciplinary DrPH degree launched in September
2021.
SBS includes domains such as the social, economic, and cultural
determinants of health and health behaviors; health promotion and
disease prevention; health disparities and population-level trends;
aging and the life course; chronic and infectious diseases;
immigration; reproductive health; access to care; and urban health.
In addition to SBS, GPH includes Departments of Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, Public Health Policy and Management, as well as

initiative that aims to promote and support intervention
optimization by (a) creating an intellectual community of
interested faculty at NYU and throughout the greater New York City
area, and (b) providing resources related to optimization
methods.  The candidate will have the opportunity to connect
with various other school-wide initiatives, including (but not
limited to) the NYU Implementation Science Working Group and the
Center for Drug Use and HIV research.
Candidates for this position should have a depth of knowledge in
their own discipline; strong methodological skills; enthusiasm for
networking with other faculty members interested in using
optimization methods in their intervention research; a passion for
and strength in teaching; openness to collaborations with other NYU
faculty; an active, externally-funded research portfolio in
intervention science; and strong and demonstrated commitment to and
experience in intervention optimization via application of the
multiphase optimization strategy (MOST).  The successful

A Diversity and Inclusion Statement


Diversity & Inclusion
Statement:  At NYU we are committed to inclusive
excellence.  Inclusion is foundational to scholarly excellence
and critical to developing pathways for training students
traditionally underrepresented in the academy and/or particular
disciplines. The diversity and inclusion statement offers each
applicant the opportunity to highlight their past, present, and
future contributions to creating inclusive excellence. 
We recognize that local contexts vary across departments and
disciplines and that contributions to diversity and inclusion may
take many forms.  Efforts to cultivate inclusive excellence
might include, for example, creating opportunities for students,
faculty, and staff traditionally underrepresented in the U.S.
academy and/or particular disciplines; public or primary school
outreach (particularly to underserved communities); contributions
to the diversity of thought and perspective; efforts to increase
inclusion and equity at the university or in the local community;
as well as one’s own life experience.
Below are a few examples of contributions to inclusion that
might be developed in a diversity & inclusion statement. 
These are by no means exhaustive.  Your statement might expand
on how you have gone about fostering inclusion and building
pathways in your discipline by:

Creating an inclusive and accessible classroom/course
(including developing your skills for doing this)
Working with campus organizations that support
underrepresented, first-generation, differently-abled or
non-traditional undergraduate or graduate students
Developing discipline or area-specific pathways to majors for
such students (e.g., women in science)
Mentoring individual students, faculty or staff from diverse
backgrounds
Training international students or mentoring faculty from
developing countries
Working with your national scholarly organization on diversity,
inclusion or equity issues
Broadening the influence of your work for the public and
enhancing underserved communities by participating in K-12
classroom, museums, or other afterschool programming aimed at
fostering general education, excitement, and possibility
(particularly in underserved populations)
Providing apprenticeships and internships for pre-college
students
Participating in prison education or other adult education
programs that serve under-resourced populations
Developing educational programming through the media or social
media
Bringing results of research back to local or international
communities
Participating as a ‘public intellectual’ on timely issues
Engaging in community activities around education, social
justice, equity, and inclusion.

Description
The Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University - a
research center for practical ethics with an historical focus on
bioethics - invites applications for a tenure-track assistant
professor or recent associate professor position in
empirical approaches to bioethics, broadly
construed. Applicants may be trained in any field, with a
preference for candidates trained in one of the social sciences. A
strong background in theoretical ethics is preferred. We are
looking for candidates who integrate empirical research with
conceptual analysis. While the area of specialization within ethics
is open, we seek scholars who will complement our existing
strengths and contribute to the collegial and collaborative
environment of the Institute. Examples of possible areas of
research include ethical approaches to racial justice and health
and to health care disparities, genomics, neuroethics, or global
bioethics. The Kennedy Institute of Ethics enjoys a close working
relationship with the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics, and
candidates who can help us strengthen those ties are welcome. The
institute is committed to public ethics and to building ties with
the larger Washington, DC community, including with policy makers.
The Institute will soon be part of a cluster of collaborating
ethics institutes at Georgetown University, including an Institute
for Environmental Justice and an Institute for Data Ethics.

teaching, as well as the potential for funding part of their
position through external grants. A Ph.D. is required before the
start date of August 1, 2022. While interdisciplinary research is

background must be consistent with having their tenure home and
primary teaching responsibilities in one of the tenure-granting
departments at Georgetown University.

The presumptive teaching load is two courses per semester,
including a mixture of graduate and undergraduate classes.

be expected to supervise graduate students.

strongly encourage applications from those from underrepresented
backgrounds. The search committee will not discriminate on the

orientation, religion, age, or any other demographic identity. We

needs. We are also committed to making sure that all events
concerning this search are as accessible to participants as
possible.

fit with the position as advertised, a research statement, a

three references. The deadline for applications is November 15,

currently 7 full-time tenured/tenure-track faculty members in the
Art History program, which offers an undergraduate major and minor
and a terminal master’s degree. Current faculty concentrate in
early modern to contemporary areas, including the art, film,
architecture, and museum and historic preservation practices of
Europe, Asia, and North America. The program is developing new
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in museum
studies to broaden the application of skills developed in the Art
History major. The building that houses the School of Visual Art
and Design features McMaster Gallery, which hosts visiting artists
from the Columbia community and beyond and fosters student artists.
The School has space in Stormwater Studios, a work and exhibition
space for students, faculty, and visiting artists in downtown
Columbia.
The African American Studies Program is a vibrant
interdisciplinary unit that centers the academic study of Black
experiences, histories, and cultures at UofSC. Now in its 50th year
on campus, the program offers a B.A. degree and an undergraduate
minor, as well as cross-listed courses that are available to
graduate students. The curriculum is led by award-winning core
faculty with coursework across the humanities and social sciences,
including specializations in African American literature, poetry,
and comics, Black activism and political thought, Gospel music,
modern dance, criminal justice, psychology, and anthropology of the
African diaspora. In addition, the program houses the Institute for
African American Research that facilitates scholarly initiatives
and supports the intellectual life at the University.
UofSC offers faculty and resources to support teaching,
research, and collaboration on topics in diasporic studies, with a
special focus on South Carolina’s particularly rich history,
culture, and connections across the Atlantic world. Highlights
include the McKissick Museum and South Caroliniana Library, which
collect, steward, exhibit, and research the history, natural
resources, and culture of the region. The History Center, Institute
of Southern Studies, and the newly launched Humanities
Collaborative also offer programming and opportunities for
collaboration with faculty across the humanities. There are
resources to support faculty and student collaborative research and
for students to pursue independent research under the supervision

Scholars/Fellows, the Honors College, and Maxcy and Preston
communities. The Walker Institute includes African Studies, Latin
American Studies, and Global Studies and offers academic and

candidates able to teach U.S. foreign
policy are especially encouraged; other fields of

The successful applicant will join a top-ranking research
institution and a team of internationally-recognized scholars. GU-Q
was established in 2005 alongside eight other elite international
universities in Education City in partnership with Qatar
Foundation. GU-Q is an integral part of Georgetown University,
delivering the renowned School of Foreign Service's Bachelor in
Foreign Service: a liberal arts program offering majors in
International Politics, International History, Culture and
Politics, and International Economics. Several MA programs are in
development. Degrees are issued by Georgetown University. GU-Q is a
research-focused and student-oriented institution with a globally
competitive research and publications record; it houses its own
Center for International and Regional Studies (CIRS). We value

opportunities offered by the wider academic eco-system of Education
City.

Core faculty positions are full-time positions designed to
replicate the institutional commitment to academic freedom and
professional opportunities associated with tenure-track and tenured
appointments, in conformity/compliance with Georgetown University's
academic governance guidelines.

The teaching load for core faculty is 2-2. Assistant Professors are
eligible for a one-semester fully-paid Junior Faculty Research
Fellowship, typically taken in the third or fourth year of service
at GU-Q. GU-Q provides generous research support and support for
conference travel. Faculty at Georgetown University in Qatar are

an additional 2/9 of the base salary. The expatriate benefits
package includes: fully-furnished high-quality housing,
transportation allowance, annual family home leave allowance,

Department of Psychology

The College of Natural and Behavioral Sciences is one of six main
instructional academic units of the university. The Psychology
Department, an academic unit within the college, offers its
students the option to pursue a wide variety of areas in the study
of human and animal behavior while simultaneously providing a solid
foundation in research and scientific aspects of the field of
psychology. For students with a general interest in psychology,
many of our courses are fundamental in understanding oneself and
relating to others more effectively. At the undergraduate level,
the Department of Psychology provides opportunity for the study of
different aspects of the field. For students interested in the
research and scientific aspects, courses on the application of the
scientific method to the study of human and animal behavior are
offered. For those with applied interests, courses relating to
counseling, clinical, and health psychology as well as behavioral
medicine, industrial and organizational psychology, computers, and
service in community agencies are offered.

diversity and equal opportunity in higher education through their
teaching, research, and service.

service, courses taught, recruitment and retention activities - and
describe how their professional skills, experience and/or
willingness to engage in related activities would enhance campus
diversity and equity efforts.

select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position. Candidates
whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree exactly as
listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent qualifications
are encouraged to complete and submit the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency (Download PDF
reader) (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:
Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.
Candidate's transcripts state: “Master's degree in agricultural
science”.
Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in
the example do not EXACTLY MATCH the degree listed in the minimum
qualifications section, this candidate MUST complete the 
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency (Download PDF
reader) in order to be considered (Download PDF reader). When completing
the form, be sure to explain in detail how your qualifications are
equivalent to the required minimum qualifications. Do not assume
that you do not need to submit a Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency because your degree is similar to a degree stated in
the minimum qualifications. Degree titles that are not an exact
match will not be considered outside of the equivalency
process.
The equivalency review is an independent
process for district wide disciplines that is separate from the
recruitment process to fill a vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline
experts that is coordinated by an Academic Senate President will
review the equivalency materials and make a recommendation as to
whether or not the applicant demonstrated they have qualifications
that are equivalent to those shown in the minimum qualifications
section of the job posting. For disciplines that are unique to a
specific campus the equivalency may be done by the hiring committee
along with an Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the
hiring committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process. 

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by
which equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD
Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD
Administrative Policy 7211.

UNIVERSITY / COMMUNITY
WHY BEMIDJI:
Bemidji State University is nestled among the pines along the
shores of Lake Bemidji, just blocks from a thriving downtown
community. In this Northwoods setting, students, staff, and faculty
have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all
the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a
tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who
always come out to cheer for the Beavers. While the city of Bemidji
— named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung (nicknamed Bemidji) —
is home to a diverse population of more than 15,000 people, it
serves a regional population of more than 100,000.
 
Located between three American Indian reservations – Leech Lake,
Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University have
the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history.
Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and
Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet
students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.
 
Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban
conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State is
conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy
coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally
owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown
Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the
Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores
and restaurants.

The College:
Established in 2020, the new College of Ethnic Studies (CoES) is
the second such college in the nation. It houses three departments:
Asian and Asian American Studies, Chicana(o) and Latina(o) Studies,

leaders who engage in rigorous, self-reflexive study that motivates

identifies as “the intellectual arm of the revolution.” PAS
encompasses the systematic investigation of the history, culture,
social relationships, political economy, literature, arts, and
languages of peoples of African descent and their contribution to
world civilization. In order to give students a unique foundation
for critical thinking and socio-cultural analysis, the curriculum
combines in-depth and transnational approaches to the study of the
Black experience. In particular, PAS places African American
Studies in a larger comparative context of Africa and the African
Diaspora—thus the name ""Pan-African"" Studies. Moreover, the goal of
the curriculum is to allow for flexibility in required core and
elective courses. The Department maintains the commitment to
community-engagement foundational to the discipline and is
intentional in its intersectional approach inclusive of gender,
sexuality, and gender identity. This approach maximizes student
ability to determine areas of emphasis and, with faculty
advisement, to select a creative set of courses that expose majors
and minors to the historical context, fundamental concepts, central
issues, and methodological evolution of Pan-African Studies.

POSITION TITLE: ASSISTANT OR ASSOCIATE

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:

Public Policy and Administration (PPA) is a department within the
College of Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies at
California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State). The
mission of the PPA Department at the “Capital Campus” of Sacramento
State is to prepare future leaders to address the complex issues
that face California. We serve the State of California and the
Sacramento Region by developing leaders with strong analytical
tools and a deep commitment to public service. We are excited to be
part of “Sac State Downtown”— a hub for innovative teaching,
learning, and research, fostering collaborative partnerships to
address real-world issues and improve the quality of life in the
Sacramento region.

The Master's in Public Policy and Administration (MPPA) Program
(https://www.csus.edu/college/social-sciences-interdisciplinary-studies/public-policy-administration/)
offered by the PPA Department provides professional training for
graduate students—many of whom work in state or local government.
Our core academic program is a Master of Public Policy and

Governance for matriculated graduate students. We participate in,
or affiliate with, the Doctorate in Educational Leadership degree,
the Judicial Administration Certificate Program, and the Executive

Capital Fellows Programs).

PPA faculty focus on developing engaging curricula that include
project-based work and application to current policy and
administrative issues in California. Courses are taught primarily
during evenings to accommodate students who are full-time working
professionals. Our curriculum is evidence-based, with a strong
focus on ensuring that students leave the program with the ability
to: (1) synthesize, analyze, and offer ideas to improve policy and
practice; (2) apply knowledge and skills in a professional setting;
and (3) recognize the role of profession in society. A particular
focus we instill in all our graduates is how to analyze systems and
practices to surface systemic biases, including structural racism,
that advance or impede a more just and equitable society.

The position is for a tenure-track assistant or associate professor
(depending upon qualifications and previous experience) starting in

chairperson within the next two to five years.

the community through California State University's Downtown
Center, visit

successful candidate should have evidence of a record in teaching,
scholarship, and service that emphasizes service to diverse
populations. Through previous work, and a clear plan, the
successful applicant should have an applied research agenda focused
on understanding and analyzing contemporary issues related to
social and racial equity. Examples of desired subject areas include
the study of public policy and administration through a defined
lens of social justice and equity-related to political engagement,
education, public finance, urban redevelopment, transportation,
health care, climate change, affordable housing, homelessness,
criminal justice, unemployment, poverty, environmental justice, or
other similar issues.

with the potential for buyout or reassignment.

Diversity and inclusion are defining features of California's

educators to better reflect the population of California is just
one aspect of the College of Education's dedication to just,
equitable and inclusive education. Diversity refers to the variety
of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from
differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include
race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language,
abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
geographic region, and more. All College of Education students
leave with a perspective that recognizes, honors, and respects the
knowledge and strengths all learners bring from their communities
and identities. This perspective is known as Just Equitable and
Inclusive Education (JEIE) and is evident in all our programs.
College of Education students use this perspective to make
community-based assets an integral component of curricular and
pedagogical development to enhance academic success. In this way,
our students learn to value and draw upon students' backgrounds not
only to support them in developing skills leading to success in the
broader society, but also as a mechanism to transform our schools
and communities. We believe that all faculty and staff who work for
the College must share these same commitments. Click here http://ed.fullerton.edu/about-the-college/jeie.php

emphasis on the intersectionality between JEIE and a social
identity or marker (social class, race, gender, sexual orientation,
language, etc.).

This statement can take several different forms and should address
at least one of the following:
your contributions to advancing principles focused on
JEIE;
how you incorporate principles of JEIE into your instructional

this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,

Assistant Professor in Design and Data/Data Analysis

About Northeastern:
Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and
the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our
world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students,
faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the
confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto;
Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and
Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through
this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:
The Department of Art + Design in the College of Arts, Media and
Design (CAMD) and D'Amore-McKim School of Business (DMSB) invite
applications and nominations for a joint appointment in Design and
Data/Data Analysis at the rank of Assistant Professor. The
opportunity to build a new research cluster across Design and Data
aligns both with DMSB's strategic plan to build leadership in
digital convergence, specifically in the area of data analytics,
with CAMD's focus on Data and Design, which encompasses data
visualization but also moves to use design as a critical field to
interrogate the nature of data itself. Successful candidates will
have the opportunity to collaborate with the Center for Design
https://camd.northeastern.edu/center-for-design/
and DATA Initiative (Digital, Analytics, Technology and Automation)
https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/data-initiative/.
Tenure home will be decided based on the finalist.

Responsibilities:
The ideal candidate is able to face complex and ill-defined
problems, understand the dynamics of controversial socio-technical
issues, and follow an integrative and holistic approach to design.
The applicants should embrace creative research questions of how
technologically mediated action is lived, felt, and valued by
people with manifold intentions in everyday situations, and have
perspectives on human experience as a process of making sense of
the world, participating in culture, and engaging with
community.

With data and information becoming powerful, pervasive, and
controversial, we value accomplished designers and researchers
deeply committed to creating meaningful, data-oriented, and
human-driven experiences and services that balance the
opportunities for value creation for multiple organization
stakeholders with the threats inherent in data processes and
governance. Strong ability to master data transformations using
different methods and languages across multiple disciplines—along
with leveraging a broader framework to advance the field of design
research and scholarship—is also required.

We encourage candidates whose research creates value for a wide
range of firms and non-profit organizations by:

creating new methodologies for making data accessible, meaningful,
and actionable;

capturing, processing, and visualizing data effectively to inform
design processes and decisions and evaluate the value of
design;

creating data-driven design applications that incorporate consumer
insights to inform new product and service development;

designing for business processes, given decreasing data capture
costs; and

questioning and inventing new norms of ethical data use.

Qualifications:
Candidates must have a PhD, MDes/MFA, MBA, or equivalent terminal
degree by the appointment start date in visual, interactive,
experience, or information design, and or marketing, management, or
related fields that ensure the ability to transform data into
meaningful experiences. Applicants should have expertise in one or
more areas of design practice or business management, an
outstanding active research record, a research agenda that aligns
with University and College strategic areas, and a willingness to
collaborate across the University.


Preferred Qualifications:
Evidence of a high level of skill and accomplishment across media,
provocative meaning-making, a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility,
and a strong publication and exhibition record is required.
Candidates should have a well-developed research agenda that will
inform and advance current trends in the field and potentially
contribute in unique ways to furthering the reputation of CAMD and
DMSB.

Candidates should have a strong interest in interdisciplinary
collaboration and experience in or a commitment to working with
diverse student populations in a culturally diverse work and
educational environment. Successful applicants will demonstrate
potential for having a national and international record of
excellence in creative practice, innovative research, substantive
scholarship, and effective teaching.

Salary Grade:
Salary will be determined, commensurate with experience.

Additional Information:
All applications must be submitted electronically at https://careers.hrm.northeastern.edu.
Please include a letter of application, a curriculum vitae, a
research statement that includes a link to a portfolio of research
and professional outcomes, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and
contact information for at least three references who may be
contacted at a later date.

Inquiries may be directed to Associate Professor Ann McDonald,
chair of the search committee, a.mcdonald@northeastern.edu.

Please do not submit additional materials until/unless requested.
Applications received on or before 1/15/2021 will be guaranteed
full review and consideration. This position will remain open until
filled. Preferred start date is for the 2021-2022 academic
year.
