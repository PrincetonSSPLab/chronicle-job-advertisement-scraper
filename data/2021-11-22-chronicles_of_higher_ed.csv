The School of Architecture at The University of Arizona seeks a
dynamic and creative leader to serve as Director, the chief
academic and administrative officer of the school. We seek a
Director who will partner with faculty, staff, and students to
articulate a compelling, creative vision for the school’s pedagogy,
research, outreach, and operations, and design a viable plan for
its phased implementation. The school currently offers three
degrees: two accredited professional degrees—the B.Arch and
M.Arch—and one post-professional research-centered degree, the
MS.Arch. In our relatively small, nimble college, there are ample
opportunities to forge interdisciplinary collaborations at all
levels with sister programs in the School of Landscape Architecture
and Planning; in addition to the BLA, MLA, and MSUP, it offers
programs in Sustainable Built Environments and Real Estate
Development. Both School Directors report to the Dean of the
College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture.
 
We seek a Director who will cherish the particularity of our
place as an inspiration for reflection and creativity, who can
capitalize on our distinctive identity in Arizona, amplify our
voice in national discourse, and expand our international
visibility. In all these settings, a demonstrated commitment to
inclusivity and ability to foster a diverse community and diverse
contributions is essential. In particular, we desire someone who
can capitalize on the history of local indigenous peoples and the
university’s designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution.
 
The School
The School of Architecture at UArizona has long been a leader in
sustainable design in resource-constrained contexts. Due to its
location in the Sonoran Desert, the School has pursued strategies
for living in and stewarding arid lands for decades, while also
promoting an architecture of structural innovation, material
experimentation, and service to local communities. The professional
B.Arch program is currently ranked 9th by Design
Intelligence among similar programs at public institutions and
23rd among such programs at all institutions. It is by far the
largest program in the school and college, with more than 435
students. It is now accompanied by a still-growing M.Arch program
and a newly re-launched MS.Arch program, together enrolling more
than 40 graduate students. All these degrees carry the federal STEM
designation. In addition, the school contributes courses to several
other undergraduate and graduate programs and Architecture faculty
have joint appointments or courtesy appointments in nine other
programs, among them the Arizona Institutes for Resilience, UA
Institute on Place, Wellbeing and Performance, the School of
Information, the School of Art, and several Graduate
Interdisciplinary Programs.
 
The school boasts a longstanding design-build program, spacious
studios, a large and well-equipped materials lab, regular study
abroad offerings, and a growing program of fundraising. Our engaged
faculty (20 full-time and 20 part-time), award-winning pedagogies,
active research programs, and commitment to educating an
increasingly diverse student body make the school a rich setting
for experimentation and leadership in the design and study of the
built environment. Read more about the school at https://capla.arizona.edu/academics/school-of-architecture.
 
The College
The College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture
issued a CAPLA Strategic Plan in 2019 and the research
profile of the college, publication output, and grant revenues have
grown strongly as a result. The college contributes to the land
grant mission of the university in part through the Drachman
Institute, which facilitates community planning and design via
outreach projects focused on design-build, water infrastructure,
and more. Finally, we are a recognized leader at UArizona for our
equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts; on this, see https://capla.arizona.edu/equity-diversity-inclusionhttps://capla.arizona.edu/equity-diversity-inclusion.
For additional information on all these facets of the college and
our commitment to building a changing world, visit: https://capla.arizona.edu/about;
https://capla.arizona.edu/about/vision-strategic-plan;
and https://capla.arizona.edu/about/annual-report.
In addition to the degrees listed above, the college offers several
Graduate Certificates and dual degrees. Recently, it launched a
microcampus program in Lima, Peru (https://lima.arizona.edu and

https://capla.arizona.edu/studio/capla-partners-upc-lima-launch-global-microcampus-program-sustainable-built-environments)
and is contemplating other international partnerships.
 
The University
The University of Arizona is the flagship research institution
of the state and is ranked 20th nationally among public research
institutions. It is the oldest public institution of higher
learning in Arizona (dating to 1885), founded as a land grant
university on homelands of the Tohono O’odham and Pascua Yaqui
peoples. It serves more than 46,000 students, over 30% of whom are
Hispanic. For more information, see: https://www.arizona.edu/about,
https://uair.arizona.edu/content/overview.
UArizona has particular strengths in the fields of earth
sciences, arid lands, hydrology, natural resources, indigenous
languages, sociology, and public health, many of which relate to
design of the built environment. The CAPLA research initiative
“RESTRUCT” has built partnerships across campus in fulfilment of
both the college and the university strategic plans. The current
UArizona strategic plan dates to 2018; it may be found here:
https://arizona.app.box.com/s/u4g5d2a0vvurwc3gfdx63e5ftbg22u78.
 
The City and Region
The site of Tucson on the Santa Cruz River lies within the
northern reaches of the beautiful and ecologically rich Sonoran
Desert. It is the oldest continuously inhabited place in the
continental United States and boasts a rich history of indigenous,
Spanish colonial, Mexican, and Anglo settlement, not to mention the
more recent influx of Asian-Americans, refugees from Africa and the
Middle East, and others. It hosts a population of over one million
people in the larger metropolitan area. Indeed, Southern Arizona
has been a magnet for travelers, tourists, artists, scientists,
naturalists, archaeologists, other scholars, and retirees since the
nineteenth century. In 2015, Tucson became the first UNESCO City of
Gastronomy in the US, joining the UNESCO Creative Cities
Network (UCCN). Located about 60 miles from the international
border with Mexico, fast-growing Tucson and its surrounding region
serve as a model of the mix of socio-political, demographic, and
environmental changes soon coming to the rest of the country.
 
Position Responsibilities
The Director’s responsibilities include:

Cultivation of community via equitable,
inclusive faculty and staff hiring, mentoring, and assessment: the
Director must be able to energize and build the faculty and staff,
demonstrating transparency in articulation of values, goals, and
processes
Research development via tireless advocacy for
work on emerging issues of the built environment

and we offer many opportunities for internships and service work

POSITION TITLE: ASSISTANT OR ASSOCIATE
PROFESSOR

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:

Public Policy and Administration (PPA) is a department within the
College of Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies at
California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State). The
mission of the PPA Department at the “Capital Campus” of Sacramento
State is to prepare future leaders to address the complex issues
that face California. We serve the State of California and the
Sacramento Region by developing leaders with strong analytical
tools and a deep commitment to public service. We are excited to be
part of “Sac State Downtown”— a hub for innovative teaching,
learning, and research, fostering collaborative partnerships to
address real-world issues and improve the quality of life in the
Sacramento region.

The Master's in Public Policy and Administration (MPPA) Program
(https://www.csus.edu/college/social-sciences-interdisciplinary-studies/public-policy-administration/)
offered by the PPA Department provides professional training for
graduate students—many of whom work in state or local government.
Our core academic program is a Master of Public Policy and
Administration (MPPA). We also offer a Certificate in Collaborative
Governance for matriculated graduate students. We participate in,
or affiliate with, the Doctorate in Educational Leadership degree,
the Judicial Administration Certificate Program, and the Executive
and Judicial Fellows Programs (part of the nationally recognized
Capital Fellows Programs).

PPA faculty focus on developing engaging curricula that include
project-based work and application to current policy and
administrative issues in California. Courses are taught primarily
during evenings to accommodate students who are full-time working
professionals. Our curriculum is evidence-based, with a strong
focus on ensuring that students leave the program with the ability
to: (1) synthesize, analyze, and offer ideas to improve policy and
practice; (2) apply knowledge and skills in a professional setting;
and (3) recognize the role of profession in society. A particular
focus we instill in all our graduates is how to analyze systems and
practices to surface systemic biases, including structural racism,
that advance or impede a more just and equitable society.

POSITION DETAILS:

The position is for a tenure-track assistant or associate professor
(depending upon qualifications and previous experience) starting in
Spring 2022 or Fall 2022. Through this position, the university is

policy and/or public administration, with an exhibited focus in
teaching, research, and community service related to social and
racial equity. Furthermore, we prefer that the hire has an interest
in actively helping to shape the PPA Department's future and
possibly taking a leadership role in the PPA Department as a
chairperson within the next two to five years.

The Department is seeking a scholar interested in contributing to
the community through California State University's Downtown
Center, visit 
https://www.csus.edu/experience/anchor-university/sac-state-downtown/
and the Anchor University Initiative, visit https://www.csus.edu/experience/anchor-university/.
Given the demographics of the Sacramento Region and California, the
successful candidate should have evidence of a record in teaching,
scholarship, and service that emphasizes service to diverse
populations. Through previous work, and a clear plan, the
successful applicant should have an applied research agenda focused
on understanding and analyzing contemporary issues related to
social and racial equity. Examples of desired subject areas include
the study of public policy and administration through a defined
lens of social justice and equity-related to political engagement,
education, public finance, urban redevelopment, transportation,
health care, climate change, affordable housing, homelessness,
criminal justice, unemployment, poverty, environmental justice, or
other similar issues.

JOB DUTIES:

with the potential for buyout or reassignment.

Engage in scholarly and professional activities related to
public policy and/or public administration.

Supervise master's projects related to public policy and/or

recently established Center for
Cyber-Physical Systems, as well as with other departments and
institutes within and outside the College of Engineering.
 
Applications are sought in areas that interface data science and
artificial intelligence with Machine Learning Applications in
Cyber-Physical Systems Security, in particular IoT, embedded
systems, cyber-security and surveillance systems, smart energy and
control systems, sensor networks,  machine/deep learning, and
data analytics. The College of Engineering creates an ideal
environment for candidates looking to explore security and
resilience issues in Embedded Systems, IoT and CPS applications,
which include but are not limited to AI-based decision making,
robotics, smart grids, access control and cybersecurity, smart
infrastructure and agriculture, medical/health data analytics and

The College of Engineering at the University of Georgia is
seeking to grow and diversify its programs through investments in
faculty with expertise in Resilient Infrastructure for
Sustainability and Equity (RISE).  The College invites
applications for multiple open rank, 9-month tenured or
tenure-track faculty positions at the Assistant, Associate, or Full
Professor level. These positions will start on August 1, 2022, and
are academic year appointments (9 months) with the opportunity to
supplement salary during the summer.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to
demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensure
that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity in
our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of
the University and 
College, and this hiring initiative will make use of the best
practices to ensure an inclusive search process.  The Diversity
and Inclusion Plan for the college identifies priority areas
for our investments and through the 2021-2022 academic year we will
develop a Diversity Strategic Plan as part of a campus-wide effort.
The college offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty
that support professional development. Several programs exist to
enhance the inclusiveness of our college, including a student-led
Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes
discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.  
Multiple positions are available in the field of Resilient
Infrastructure for Sustainability and Equity (RISE). Aging
infrastructure, urbanization, pollution and climate change are
impacting communities and livelihoods with significant investments
being made in infrastructure. The RISE interdisciplinary cluster
will unite and catalyze strengths in data science, engineering
(including Engineering With Nature®, natural infrastructure, and
green engineering), environmental and atmospheric sciences, urban
systems, public service and outreach, public administration, and
law and policy to establish UGA as an international leader in smart
and resilient infrastructure systems that protect people, their
livelihoods, and their communities from severe weather impacts,
climate change, man-made hazards, pollution, unsafe or degraded
infrastructures, and other disruptions. The RISE cluster will
produce fundamental research on next generation infrastructure and
systems with emphasis on vulnerable communities connected with
important assets including critical transportation infrastructure,
military installations, ports and urban systems (e.g., water,
wastewater, solid waste systems).
 
Applications are sought in areas interfacing with data science and
artificial intelligence that may include: Smart Interconnected
Infrastructure Systems, Operations Research Using AI for
Vulnerability and Risk Analysis of Critical Infrastructure Systems,
Riverine-Coastal Infrastructure Engineering, Hydrologic &
Hydraulic Engineering and Smart Water Systems, AI Geotechnics,
AI-Empowered Intelligent Transportation Systems, Green Engineering
and Urban and/or Rural System Material Circularity Informatics. The
College of Engineering creates an ideal environment for candidates
seeking opportunities to work in interdisciplinary collaborations
across campus and address resilience issues in communities,
especially those most at risk, and infrastructure systems around
the world. 
The hiring is part of a campus-wide Presidential
Interdisciplinary Faculty Hiring Initiative in Data Science and
Artificial Intelligence that aims to recruit 50 faculty members who
will educate students and advance research in data science and AI
over the next two years. Rather than being housed exclusively in a
single department, however, the majority of UGA’s newly recruited
faculty will focus on the fusion of data science and AI in
cross-cutting areas such as infectious diseases, integrative
precision agriculture, ethics, cybersecurity, resilient communities
and the environment.
 
The College of Engineering already has significant expertise in
the areas of Transportation and Structural Systems, Geotechnical
Engineering, Resilient and Natural Infrastructure, Water
Management, Urban Systems, New Materials, Plastic Pollution and
Solid Waste Management. Examples are the interdisciplinary team of
researchers and educators in the School of Environmental,
Civil Agricultural and Mechanical Engineering and colleagues
affiliated with the Institute
for Resilient Infrastructure Systems, New Materials Institute, as
well as with other departments and institutes within and outside
the College of Engineering.  
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a rapidly
growing engineering college that combines interdisciplinary
research and scholarship with excellent instruction and service.
The UGA College of Engineering currently enrolls over 2,500
engineering majors and has over 80 full-time faculty across
fifteen-degree programs.  Significant investments in
infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of laboratory
facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms and
instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have space
in two major capital projects on campus to create interdisciplinary
research facilities. Our main instructional facility has also
undergone complete renovation to create flexible classrooms that
enable a range of teaching modalities and the incorporation of
interdisciplinary instructional labs. The common instructional
facilities also foster diversity since they allow faculty, staff,
and students to interact and collaborate in a single facility.
 
 
Minimum Qualifications
A Ph.D. in any engineering discipline relevant to the field of
resilient infrastructures.

These commitments further our mission as a public
university, dedicated to the promise of democratic life, and
consistently engaged with the unfinished struggles for democracy,
freedom, and justice with which our national and institutional
histories are so deeply entangled. The present historical
moment—and the deep histories that have produced it—call us to
engage with renewed urgency the particular histories of inequality
affecting Black communities in the United States and across the
globe. Our hiring, research, teaching, and institutional practices
and commitments must respond to that call.
 
As part of this initiative, UVA Arts & Sciences

These new faculty members will join a community of
colleagues at UVA already working in and across disciplines on the
social, cultural, political, historical, and environmental
questions that are central to African, African-American, and

justice. The schools are dedicated to cultivating an equitable,
inclusive community founded on respect for all persons. Students,
staff and faculty from many diverse belief systems and backgrounds

themselves with passion and integrity to their disciplines and to a
transformative education of their students. Please view our

members develop relationships with students in small classroom
settings and have opportunities to work closely with students on
research projects, experiential learning experiences, and study
abroad programs. Recent initiatives to create a dynamic general
education curriculum and to develop plans for a new teaching and
learning center demonstrate strong institutional support for
faculty development. For further information, see http://www.csbsju.edu.

enable equitable access to online information; the collaborative
establishment of non-commercial online resources and practices; the
role libraries play in the open-access ecosystem; the consideration
of biases within the terminology, architecture, and encoding of

incarceration, etc.; theorization of racism and its persistence and
impact, historical racial formations; scholarship on anti-racist
resistance and movement-building and transnational and inter-group

Founded in 1906, Georgia Southern University is a Carnegie
Doctoral/R2 institution with a focus on public-impact research,
serving about 27,000 students on three beautiful campuses in
Statesboro, Savannah, and Hinesville, and via a growing online
program. Through its degree offerings at the associate's,
bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels, Georgia Southern offers a
distinctive combination of community collaboration, world-class
scholarship, innovative teaching, and hands-on learning
opportunities.

equity, and inclusion, we actively seek candidates with a
demonstrated commitment to Inclusive Excellence. Candidates whose

coursework in foundational concepts; clinical instruction in
assessment, intervention, prevention, and counseling; volunteerism
and advocacy. The program teaches graduate students to evaluate and
utilize evidence from scientific research; to think critically in
order to solve clinical problems; to convey complex health
information through written and spoken modalities; collaborate
effectively to realize exceptional clinical outcomes; and to act
ethically to serve clients within a culturally and linguistically
diverse society as outlined in the accreditation standards of the
Council on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language
Pathology of the American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association.

As a unit, the Communication Sciences and Disorders program
supports these core values:

experiential, and rigorous leading to student success.
A balance among service, teaching, mentoring, and
scholarship.
An environment of mutual trust and collegiality that respects
diversity in professional collaborations and the clinical
populations served.

resilient communities and the environment.
The College of Pharmacy will utilize this initiative to
demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensure

the University and Colleges, and this hiring initiative will make
use of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process.
The Diversity and Inclusion Plan for our College identifies

initiative follows a translational science paradigm using
evidence-based research to support the implementation of more
refined approaches to improving the health of individual
patients.
The Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy is
seeking an outstanding candidate to join its Pharmaceutical Health
Services, Outcomes, and Policy (PHSOP) program to provide

College of Education
Illinois State University has a historic and enduring commitment to
prepare teachers and other school personnel who will be responsive
to the ethical and intellectual demands of a democratic society. To
teach in a democracy is self-consciously to take up the challenge
of improving the ethical and intellectual quality of our societal
dialogue by including in it as many educated voices as possible.
The democratic ideal unites caring and knowing: the more voices we
call into thoughtful dialogue, and the less fettered the mutual
exchange among those voices becomes, the truer our convictions and
conclusions will be. This is the foundation of a democratic
society, and it is why ISU graduates aspire to teach everyone,
especially those on the margins, those who have been or are in
danger of being excluded. This democratic conception of education

Tips for faculty applications
When the Search Committee reviews applications for positions,
the information you provide is scored against a rubric that is
built off of the position announcement.  The highest scoring
candidates will usually be invited for a phone interview. 
Following the phone interview, the highest scoring candidates will
be invited for an in-person interview that will last approximately
a day and a half.  So are you wondering how to make it to that
short list?  Here are a few tips to follow in preparing your
application materials.

Read the Position Announcement carefully and make sure you meet
the Required Qualifications.
Customize your application letter to the specific position and
explain to us how your qualifications match those sought in the
position announcement.  A good, solid cover letter for an
entry level position typically runs around 1½ to 2 pages single
spaced.  If a person has extensive relevant experience to
relate, the letter could run 2 to 3 pages.
Provide us with a Curriculum Vita (CV), not a business-style
resume.  This means include all experience or activities that
provide relevant information about your qualifications for the
position or what you can bring to it.  There are no page
limits on a CV, longer and more complete is better than
brevity.  But make sure what you include is relevant.
Do not assume we will know the details about your activities or
experience.  Explain in your cover letter or as part of your
vita what you have actually accomplished in a position or activity
and how it relates to the qualifications for the position.  If
you want to point to a specific activity as an example of your
leadership skills, explain why and what impact it had or what you
learned from it.  If you want us to consider prior specific
experience, you need to tell us what your responsibilities included
or what you accomplished in the role.
Check your grammar and accuracy in spelling. Do not rely on MS
Word to catch everything and watch that auto-correct did not make a
mistake.  It is considered bad form to misspell the name of
the person to whom you are sending the application.
Provide concrete examples of your intellectual output (such as
links to guides, handouts, institutional repository submissions,
etc.).
Do not overlook telling us about your interpersonal skills or
work style.  Enthusiastic, supportive of diversity, dynamic,
creative, customer-service oriented are all legitimate
characteristics we are seeking.  Tell us how you are a fit for
them.

modernist aesthetics, for example through a consideration of
colonialism, race, and/or sexuality. Along these lines, we welcome
work that is interdisciplinary and in conversation with fields
including, but not limited to: Black Studies, Disability Studies,
Critical Gender and Sexuality Studies, ecocriticism, or new
media.

Ideal candidates should demonstrate the potential to build an
excellent record of research, teaching, and service, as well as
demonstrable interest in working within a world literature
department with a focus on critical theory, social justice, and
cultural, ethnic, and gender studies where faculty members work in
multiple languages, geographies, and historical periods. We welcome
candidates with the potential to demonstrate excellence in
college-level teaching. Candidates will be expected to teach a
range of graduate and undergraduate courses in literature, and
cultural studies. In addition to specialized seminars, the
successful candidate should also be prepared to teach large
enrollment survey courses in contemporary U.S. literatures,

Assistant/Associate Professor in Global Health

About Northeastern:
Founded in 1898, Northeastern University is a global research
university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong
learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our
students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond
the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto;
Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and
Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through
this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern University is situated on the Avenue of the Arts in
Boston's historic Back Bay, four blocks from the Longwood Medical
Area, encompassing Harvard Medical School, Children's Hospital
Boston, Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, and eight blocks from the Boston Medical Center.
Northeastern University has an enrollment of more than 17,000
undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students and approximately 4,300
faculty and staff. Situated in downtown Boston on a campus deemed
an arboretum with its 1,400 trees representing 143 different
species, it is one of the nation's most dynamic private educational
institutions.

The Bouve College of Health Sciences has over 200
faculty members, with approximately 2,000 undergraduate and 2,400
graduate students. It is the leading national model for education
and research in the health, psychosocial and biomedical sciences
and supports the University's missions both of educating students
for a life of fulfillment and accomplishment and of creating and
translating knowledge to meet global and societal needs. Aligned
with Northeastern University's commitment to interdisciplinary
research and community engagement, we work collaboratively across
University entities.

The Department of Health Sciences is an
interdisciplinary department in the Bouve College of Health
Sciences, one of nine colleges at Northeastern University. We
provide a world-class education in a broad range of public health
and clinical careers that promote the health and well-being of
individuals, communities, and populations in culturally diverse
contexts. We are committed to evidence-based research and research
translation to eliminate health disparities. Our department is a
unique, transdisciplinary setting that incorporates teaching,
learning, and serving, in a rapidly evolving, multicultural
environment that includes perspectives based on diversity by race,
ethnicity, class, ability, language, gender, sexuality, age and
nationality. The Department of Health Sciences currently includes
45 faculty engaged in research, teaching, and practice, many of
whom are jointly appointed in other schools within Bouve and in
other colleges across the University. The department is undergoing
a significant, multi-year expansion in size and scope and has
increased by 25% in full-time faculty and over 150% in graduate
students since 2017. Our undergraduate program has experienced even
more robust growth, increasing from 127 students in 2008 to over
900 in 2021. It is playing a central role in expanding public
health programs university-wide.

About the Opportunity:
The Department of Health Sciences in the Bouve College of Health
Sciences at Northeastern University seeks applications for an
Assistant or Associate level tenured/tenure track faculty member
with an innovative research program in global public health.
Northeastern is a globally networked university with rapidly
expanding research partnerships and experiential education around
the world. While the disproportionate burden of non-communicable
diseases has cast a shadow over the 21st century, the COVID-19
pandemic shows the persistent, destructive impact posed by
infectious diseases. The evolving, complex, and mutually
reinforcing ways in which these two issues present challenges to
population health necessitate new models for public health, in
addition to traditional approaches such as the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals to alleviate poverty, social
inequalities, and preventable disease. Examples of possible
specialty areas include global disease surveillance, health impacts
of climate change, global health policy, global social inequities,
and technological/digital innovation in global health.

At Northeastern University, there is a strong interest in global
health from students across the university. There is a
university-wide interdisciplinary minor in Global Health and the
undergraduate and graduate curricula include courses in global
health at all levels and global perspectives on many public health
and health care issues within courses. Northeastern University
prioritizes research that solves global challenges, through
collaborative, cross-disciplinary and experience-powered solutions.
World-renowned existing collaborations include faculty within the
Integrated Initiative for Global Health, Global Resilience
Institute, the Network Science Institute, the Institute on Health
Equity and Social Justice Research, and all across the university.
Northeastern works to inspire a global mindset across the entire
university community. This position and others being added across
the university (see www.northeastern.edu/diversity)
will greatly expand our capacity to teach and to conduct
cutting-edge research in the global health field. The tenure home
for this position will be the Department of Health Sciences, with
the possibility of a joint appointment in another suitable
department.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork. Hires will be mentored for success, with mentoring teams
and group guidance. In addition, a strong and effective faculty

conjunction with the Office of Research Development (ORD), the
Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion (OIDI), the Center
for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and
University Decision Support (UDS) to provide programs and trainings
to further develop and support a thriving faculty.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each
person is trained and mentored to promote their success.

Northeastern University is an equal opportunity employer, seeking
to recruit and support a broadly diverse community of faculty and
staff. Northeastern values and celebrates diversity in all its
forms and strives to foster an inclusive culture built on respect
that affirms inter-group relations and builds cohesion.

About Colorado State University
Pueblo

Colorado State University Pueblo is a comprehensive state
university with an enrollment of 4,000 students. CSU Pueblo

with a small professor-to-student ratio for an ever-changing global
economy. Students can choose from 28 undergraduate programs with 70
fields of study in the College of Science and Mathematics, the
Hasan School of Business, the College of Humanities and Social
Sciences, and the College of Education, Engineering, and
Professional Studies and 10 graduate programs.

CSU Pueblo is equally committed to serving the diverse population
of the region; this emphasis is reflected in the demographic
characteristics of the student body. Because more than 25 percent
of our students are Hispanic, the Federal Government has designated
CSU Pueblo a Hispanic Serving Institution. Besides reflecting our
commitment to serve this critically important and rapidly-growing
segment of the student population, that designation also allows the
University to compete for certain federal grant funds to support
its ability to better serve all students. The University also seeks
to provide a rich and diverse cultural environment that allows
freedom of expression within a spirit of civility and mutual
respect. The public service expected of all members of our
community benefits our society--local and global--and builds our
sense of citizenship.

Among its unique features, CSU Pueblo is one of seven schools in
the nation to offer a degree in mechatronics, which combines
electrical and mechanical engineering. The Hasan School of Business
ranks among the top 15 percent of all business schools
internationally with graduate and undergraduate programs in
business administration accredited by the AACSB International Board
of Directors. The College of Education, Engineering and
Professional Studies houses an undergraduate engineering program
that was ranked in the nation's top 100 by U.S. News and
World Report. CSU Pueblo has an ever-changing campus landscape
that features a newly renovated Library, a new general academic
classroom building, and a newly renovated and
expanded student center.

At CSU Pueblo, Student Life offerings have increased significantly
with the transition of the campus from a commuter environment to a
more traditional collegiate experience. Competing at the NCAA
Division II level, CSU Pueblo is a member of the Rocky Mountain
Athletic Conference and offers 22 varsity intercollegiate sports
and also has active intramural and club sports teams that allow
students to get involved in campus life.

Texas, where three states and two countries converge along the Rio
Grande, UTEP is a public research university that transforms lives.
Ninety-four percent of UTEP's nearly 25,000 students are
minorities, and many are the first in their families to go to
college. At UTEP, students have access to 168 bachelor's, master's
and doctoral degree programs in nine colleges and schools. UTEP is
the only open-access, top tier research university in America, yet
its retention rates exceed those of selective institutions.

Located in the second-most educated city in Texas, UTEP is
recognized as one of the best research universities in the country
for connecting students with the community around them. It is one
of the only 28 institutions in the U.S. and 3 in Texas to hold both

Carnegie Foundation.

UTEP advances discovery of public value and positively impacts the
health, culture, education and economy of the community it serves.
With more than $108 million in total annual research expenditures,
the University is ranked among the top 5% of colleges and
universities in research and fifth in Texas for federal research
expenditures at public universities.

The University employs approximately 4,000 faculty, staff and
students. It has one of the lowest out-of-pocket costs of any
research university in the U.S., underscoring its commitment to
