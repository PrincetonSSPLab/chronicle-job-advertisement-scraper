mentoring, research, life experiences, or service towards building
an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.

					Bennington College invites applications for a full-time faculty
position in computer science, beginning Fall 2022. The successful
candidate will work with colleagues to create and implement an
innovative and multidisciplinary approach to Computer Science, one
that will build on our program's success of attracting students
from diverse backgrounds and with a range of academic interests.
Applicants with academic, industry, and/or artistic backgrounds in
computer science and from all sub-specializations are encouraged to
apply. The ability to teach and develop new courses in multiple
subfields of computer science that can be integrated into a broad
liberal arts curriculum is essential. An advanced degree in
computer science or a closely related field is desirable, but not
required. If desired, the option of a part-time position exists for
an exceptional candidate.

Bennington College is a small residential liberal arts college in
southern Vermont, long distinguished for its progressive approach
to higher education. The College was founded in 1932 on the
principle of active engagement in learning, which is manifest in
individualized plans of study developed by students together with
faculty. Bennington's open curricular structures facilitate
innovative teaching across traditional disciplinary boundaries and
small class sizes enable student-centered and engaged learning
within the classroom. Faculty members at Bennington are
teacher-practitioners whose professional work is in ongoing
dialogue with their teaching and advising. Full-time faculty teach
five courses per year, and fully engaged student advising is an
expectation.

Bennington serves a diverse student population inclusive of members
of ethnically/racially minoritized, international, LGBTQIA+, and
disability communities as well as diverse gender identities,
socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, and political beliefs. Our
staff and faculty also reflect diverse and intersecting backgrounds
and identities. All employees are expected to be respectful and
responsive to these differences in the service of building
community that promotes student and employee success. Each
individual (faculty, staff and students) will be accountable for
upholding these values. The College's approach to pluralism and
inclusivity—both as fields of inquiry and practice—is to prioritize
flexible thought, and to invite the examination of access, value,
power, and privilege through its institutional policies and areas
of study. We encourage applicants from diverse realms of interest,
backgrounds, experience, and accomplishment to apply.

In recognition of the employment challenges sometimes faced by
academic couples in small communities, the College will also
consider applications to share equally a single full-time faculty
position. Applicants must each submit an individual application and
indicate in their cover letters that they are applying
jointly.

Candidates should apply online below by submitting: 1) a letter of
application; 2) a curriculum vitae; 3) a statement of
teaching philosophy that includes descriptions of three potential
course offerings; 4) a statement of research interests and plans;
5) links to, or examples of, relevant recent professional work; 6)
a brief statement on the candidate's potential to contribute to an
increasingly diverse and inclusive environment through teaching,
research, and/or service; and 7) contact information for three
references.

Review of applications will begin on October 1, 2021 and will
continue until the position is filled. This position requires the
successful completion and acceptable results of a background
check.

Position Description


The Education Department at the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track
Assistant Professor in the area of Early Literacy Education.

We seek candidates who focus on early literacy education (Pre-K to
3rd Grade). We seek someone whose research contributes to
scholarship, policy, teacher preparation, curriculum, and/or
pedagogy relevant to national, state, and local literacy education
contexts, especially as relevant for linguistically, ethnically,
and racially marginalized populations in California. Possible areas
of specialization include emergent literacy/reading,
bi/multilingual literacies, critical literacy, children’s
literature/reading, digital/multimodal literacies,
pedagogy/curriculum development, equitable approaches to formative
and/or summative assessment, literacy practices across home and
school contexts, literacy and racial justice, literacy research
methods, or the social, cultural, and political dimensions of early
literacy. We are particularly interested in hiring a colleague
whose scholarship engages the transformational capacities of
education for the least-advantaged children and communities, and
animates the promise of schools and other public institutions to
forge a just democracy.

We seek scholars with a promising research program as well as a
capacity to develop externally funded research grants, projects,
and partnerships with schools, after-school programs, and/or
community-based initiatives. The successful candidate will be able
to teach across the department’s programs (Undergraduate Education
Major/Minor, MA/Teaching Credential, and PhD in Education);
collaborate with our teacher education instructors and teacher
supervisors in preparing multiple subject (elementary) teachers;
advise and mentor undergraduate, MA/credential, and PhD students;
and work with students, faculty, and staff from a wide range of
social and cultural backgrounds. We seek candidates whose
scholarship, teaching, and service advance anti-racism,
anti-oppression, equity, and justice in education. We welcome
candidates who bring a critical understanding of diversity to their
own life experiences and background, who understand the barriers
facing traditionally underrepresented groups in PK-12 and higher
education, and who have engaged in teaching, research, professional
and/or public service that promote diversity, equity, and
inclusion.

The chosen candidate will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past 10
(ten) years been formally disciplined at any academic
institution/place of employment. In the event the candidate cannot
make this representation, they will be expected to disclose in
writing to the hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal
discipline that they have received, as well as any current or
ongoing investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

how educational policies, programs, and structures may disrupt,
reify, and/or exacerbate inequities for pre-K-12 teaching and
learning and the professional lives of teachers; 3) other ways that
systemic conditions, both inside and outside of education, affect
and inform educational policies, opportunities, experiences, and
outcomes for learners and their communities. This position is open

approaches. Mixed methodologists with critical approaches to policy
analysis are strongly encouraged to apply. A demonstrated
commitment to advancing equity, justice and antiracism in research,

its five campuses (Pullman, Spokane, Tri-Cities, Vancouver, and
Everett), and online through its Global Campus. Unlike most

Thus, all SHBM faculty regardless of campus location are full
members of the SHBM department.  Also, the business curricula
at all five campuses are accredited together as one curriculum by
the AACSB (and AACSB accreditation was renewed for five years in
2019).

country by 2030. 
The Carson College of Business (CCB) enrolls 2,200 undergraduate
students and houses the US News and World Report 13th
ranked online MBA in the country, which enrolls over 700
students.  The college has 92 full-time faculty across its

reserve funds held at the college and department level.

of the oldest in the US (since 1932) and consistently ranked as one
of the top programs in the US and Internationally.  The
undergraduate degree (BA in HBM) includes three majors: Hospitality
Business Management, Wine & Beverage Business Management, and
Senior Living Management.  At the graduate level, the SHBM
offers a certificate in HBM as part of the Online MBA program as
well as a PhD program in Hospitality and Tourism Management.

368924,Assistant or Associate Professor (without tenure) - Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/368924/assistant-or-associate-professor-without-tenure-aga-khan-program-for-islamic-architecture/,False,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Massachusetts, United States",Salary Not specified,2021-08-11,"
Assistant or Associate Professor (without tenure) - Aga
Khan Program for Islamic Architecture
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Cambridge, MA
 
 
The Department of Architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is seeking to fill a tenure-track faculty position in
the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA) in the
Department of Architecture. The position is supported by a generous
gift from the Aga Khan as part of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic
Architecture (AKPIA) at MIT.
 
AKPIA is an academic leader in the study of architecture and
urbanism in the Islamic world. Over the past four decades, the
program has graduated leading scholars and practitioners in the
field of Islamic Architecture worldwide. Over this period, AKPIA’s
students have come from diverse academic and national backgrounds
to pursue either an advanced SMArchS degree focused on architecture
in the Islamic world, or a PhD degree within the framework of the
History, Theory & Criticism program with a focus on the
history, theory, and criticism of Islamic architecture or urbanism.
The current search aims to build on this tradition while further
expanding the scope and ambition of the Aga Khan program to address
pressing issues in the Islamic built environment.
 
The successful candidate will be involved primarily in the study
of architecture and/or urban design in the Islamic world, with an
interest in design, urban, social, historical and/or environmental
questions. They will aid the faculty of the program, and
department, in further extending AKPIA’s ambition to address urgent
issues facing cities and landscapes in the Islamic world. These
include contemporary issues facing the architecture of Islamic
societies in a global context; the climate crisis and its unequally
distributed effects; the problems of mass urbanization; settlement
and displacement, migration and forced displacement; heritage
issues; and the quality and conditions of civic space. An important
criterion in the search will be the ability of the candidate to
engage and collaborate across the realms of design, planning, and
contemporary and historical research necessary to engage such
essential global challenges.
 
Candidates should demonstrate evidence of engagement with, and
commitment to their work at the highest academic level. This may
include works of research, scholarship, and/or design. The
individual should be able to demonstrate an ability to develop and
teach both graduate and undergraduate courses and supervise Masters
and PhD work in an internationally recognized School of
Architecture and Planning.
 
In keeping with MIT's culture of faculty self-governance and the
Department's expectations of its faculty, the candidate is expected
to participate in the intellectual life and administrative
functioning of the department, and to contribute to the
department's research and pedagogical agendas. The individual
should enjoy collaborating with colleagues, be an articulate
communicator, and be dedicated to help steer and support the rich,
diverse culture of the Department. In pursuing research, teaching
or practice, the individual should also be an effective
representative of the department to the external world, in
particular to agencies such as the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and
the Aga Khan Development Network.
 
Dedicated to a humanistic and technologically sophisticated
vision of design, history, and pedagogy, the Department of
Architecture is uniquely positioned within the School of
Architecture and Planning and within the larger institution of MIT,
which strongly supports innovation and entrepreneurial activity,
cross-disciplinary work, and diversity. The Department is actively
committed to building and sustaining a diverse and culturally
inclusive community of faculty, students, and staff, and a learning
and research environment that welcomes and supports diverse
interests, orientations, and work. The academic structure of the
Department is unique in that each of its five disciplinary areas
(Architecture + Urbanism; Art, Culture and Technology; Building
Technology; Computation; and History, Theory and Criticism) work at
equal intensity, across boundaries, and in collaboration to create
an environment in which innovative research and scholarship fuse
with the pedagogical agendas of the studios and ongoing design
inquiry.
 
The Department engages productively in research and education
alliances with the other units in the School (e.g., the Department
of Urban Studies and Planning; Leventhal Center for Advanced
Urbanism; Media Lab; Program in Media Arts and Sciences; Program in
Art, Culture and Technology, and Center for Real Estate). In this
exciting context, the Department is explicitly committed to
excellence in both pedagogical and research activities. Believing
that the cross current between the two creates a charged atmosphere
for study and a critical edge for research, we are seeking
candidates with an ability to thrive and lead in the
Department.
 
Qualifications:

The position is designed for a junior or developing scholar for
whom a hire at the Assistant or Associate without Tenure level is
appropriate. An ability to advance a teaching and research agenda
in an academic environment are essential.
Candidates should hold a terminal degree in architecture or an
allied discipline and show proven excellence in teaching,
scholarship, design practice or a combination thereof. A Doctoral
degree is preferred but not required.
Prospective candidates should have demonstrated accomplishments
that qualify them for the above responsibilities, especially
familiarity with countries and regions with substantial Islamic
populations and their social, cultural, environmental, and
architectural contexts. An advanced degree in architecture is
required, either a professional master’s degree or doctoral degree,
as well as extensive experience in an Islamic context; fluency in
at least one language of the Islamic world is strongly
preferred.

 
 
 
Application Instructions
 
Interested applicants should submit: a statement of interest
outlining their vision and qualifications for the position,
including major professional, research, pedagogical goals and
achievements; a curriculum vitae; three current references with
contact information; and a maximum 16 page, letter-sized dossier of
professional, research or scholarly work. Review of applicants will

established in 1990 with an interdisciplinary approach to education
at its foundation. Our thriving downtown campus serves students

development of creative teaching, research, and community
collaborations. The campus commitment to diversity is central to
maintaining an atmosphere where students, staff, and faculty find
