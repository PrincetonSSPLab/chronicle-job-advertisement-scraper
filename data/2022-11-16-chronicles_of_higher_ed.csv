POSITION DESCRIPTION

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering)
at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), invites
applications for multiple Assistant and Associate Teaching
Professor positions. The successful candidates will develop and
teach courses within the undergraduate and graduate curricula with
a focus in one or more of the following fields: Programming,
Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Operating Systems,
Hardware, Computer Architectures, and Machine Learning. Selected
candidates will develop programs of academic scholarship in either
or both engineering pedagogy and their technical areas of
specialty. As educational leaders in one of the largest Computer
Science programs in the US, selected candidates will become leaders
of curriculum and pedagogical development in the department and the
school, and will be well poised to impact CS pedagogy at a national
level.

The working title of this position is Assistant or Associate
Teaching Professor, while the payroll titles are Lecturer with
Potential Security of Employment or Lecturer with Security of
Employment. These titles are used differently at the University of
California than at some other institutions. Important facts to note
are: these positions have all the rights and responsibilities of
membership in the Academic Senate; ""Security of Employment'' is
directly analogous to tenure; and the positions earn sabbatical
credit and have summer flexibility. Faculty in these positions have
Principal Investigator status for the purpose of grant applications
and administration. Faculty in these positions, as with all
faculty, are regularly reviewed for further advancement and salary
increases. The Security of Employment series is evaluated on
achievements in the areas of teaching, professional scholarship and
activity, and University and public service as set by the
University of California system.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is part of the
Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Our school has
nationally and internationally known researchers in many areas,
including theoretical computer science, programming languages,
security, distributed systems, storage systems, computer
architectures, machine learning, natural language processing,
vision, VLSI, and networking. Several research centers contribute
to the intellectual vibrancy of the university, including the
Center for Research in Open Source Software, Center for
Cyberphysical Systems Research, Center for Computational
Experience, and others. The Baskin School of Engineering is home to
six departments, contributing to the richness of its research.
Nestled in a redwood forest above the city of Santa Cruz, our
beautiful campus has a long history of embracing groundbreaking
interdisciplinary work. Our campus is the nearest University of
California campus to Silicon Valley and has close research ties
with the local computer industry. Our proximity to Silicon Valley,
and our satellite campus there, afford opportunities and avenues
for collaboration with researchers working in the many research and
development labs in Silicon Valley, as well as with the other San
Francisco Bay Area universities.

UC Santa Cruz values diversity, equity, and inclusion and is
committed to hiring faculty who will work to support these values.
UC Santa Cruz is a Minority-serving Institution (MSI) with a high
proportion of first-in-family students. To be considered,
candidates must demonstrate an understanding of the barriers facing
women, people of color, and other groups underrepresented in
engineering, as well as describe their experience and future plans
to promote equity and inclusion in teaching, mentoring, and
scholarship. Efforts supporting equity and inclusion at UC Santa
Cruz will be recognized as important during the merit review and
promotion process. The selected candidate will receive a start-up
package that includes funding in support of furthering Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion efforts.

UC Santa Cruz is a member of the Association of American
Universities (AAU, an association of the top research universities
in the US), a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), a member of the
Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Research Universities (HRSU), a member
of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI),
an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving
Institution (AANAPISI), and a member of several identity and ethnic
affinity professional societies. Broadening participation in
engineering, and equitably and inclusively serving underrepresented
minoritized students are key values at UC Santa Cruz. Selected
candidates will have multiple opportunities to participate in
programs that contribute to enhancing the diversity of our student
body, increasing its inclusivity, and working to promote equitable
outcomes for our students.

The chosen candidates will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidates cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)
