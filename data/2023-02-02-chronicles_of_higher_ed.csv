Interdisciplinary Studies

DEPARTMENT: Public Policy and Administration
(PPA)

POSITION TITLE: Tenured Faculty (Associate or Full
Professor) and Department Chair

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:

Public Policy and Administration (PPA) is a department within the
College of Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies at
California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State). The
mission of the PPA Department at the Capital Campus of
Sacramento State is to prepare future leaders to address the
complex issues that face California. We serve the State of
California and the Sacramento region by developing leaders with
strong analytical tools and a deep commitment to public service. We
are excited to be part of Sacramento State Downtown — a hub for
innovative teaching, learning, and research, fostering
collaborative partnerships to address real-world issues and improve
the quality of life in the Sacramento region.

The Master's degree in Public Policy and Administration (MPPA)
(https://www.csus.edu/college/social-sciences-interdisciplinary-studies/public-policy-administration/)
offered by the PPA Department provides professional training for
graduate students—many of whom work in state or local government.
Our students are diverse and represent populations that have been
historically underserved in both undergraduate and graduate
education.

Our core academic program is the MPPA. We also offer a Certificate
in Collaborative Governance for matriculated graduate students. We
participate in, or affiliate with, the Doctorate in Educational
Leadership degree, the Judicial Administration Certificate Program,
and the Executive and Judicial Fellows Programs (part of the
nationally recognized Capital Fellows Programs). We are a vibrant
department, expanding in students and faculty, and are looking for
a department chair who will lead our growth.

PPA faculty focus on developing engaging curricula that include
project-based work and application to current policy and
administrative issues in California. Courses are taught primarily
in the evenings to accommodate students who are full-time working
professionals. Our curriculum is evidence-based, with a strong
focus on ensuring that students leave the program with the ability
to: (1) synthesize, analyze, and offer ideas to improve policy and
practice; (2) apply knowledge and skills in a professional setting;
and (3) recognize the role of policy and administrative
professionals in society. We encourage our graduates to analyze
systems and practices to surface systemic biases, including
structural racism, that advance or impede a more just and equitable
society.

Sateren (’35) Endowed Professor and Chair of Music,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37402981/leland-b-sateren-35-endowed-professor-and-chair-of-music/,False,Augsburg University,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",Commensurate with credentials and experience,2023-01-31,"AUGSBURG UNIVERSITY invites Applications and Nominations for the Leland B. Sateren (’35) Endowed Professor and Chair of Music position
Start Date: August 2023
The Leland B. Sateren Professorship was established in 2022 by Augsburg alumnus and Regent John N. Schwartz '67.  Sateren, a renowned composer and conductor, served as chair of the Augsburg Department of Music from 1950 to 1973, and as director of the Augsburg Choir from 1950 until his retirement in 1979.  As a student, Schwartz studied Business Administration, while also participating in the breadth of experiences the music program had to offer. Singing in the choir under the direction of Sateren shaped Schwartz’s liberal arts education and a life-long passion for music, especially choral music. His gift honors the legacy of Leland Sateren while positioning Augsburg's music program for a transformational future.
Augsburg University, centrally located in Minneapolis MN, offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and eleven graduate degree programs to approximately 3,500 students of diverse backgrounds. With a student/faculty ratio of 12:1, the university focuses on close personal interaction among students and faculty as well as experiential education on campus and in the community. An Augsburg education is defined by excellence in the liberal arts and professional studies, guided by the faith and values of the Lutheran church and shaped by the university’s urban and global settings.
We seek a transformational leader and accomplished teacher-scholar who is professionally and personally committed to core values of creativity, diversity, and integration (CMS Task Force Report on the Undergraduate Music Major, 2016), and who will lead us boldly and collaboratively. The successful candidate will bring experience in addressing the creative tension that a leader in Music today must hold. The successful candidate will be expected to lead our music program in a collaborative and transformational process that positions us for a bold future.  Candidates who fully embrace Augsburg’s mission, values, and aspirational outcomes are expected. Candidates who have demonstrated success as music program leaders in advancing inclusion, access, equity, and belonging in music programs are preferred. Candidates with prior line authority, experience in budgeting, strategic decision-making, and the ability to advocate effectively for the department and its work among diverse constituents are preferred.
The inaugural Sateren Professor will serve as a visionary leader of Augsburg’s music programs, and further strengthen a music department at an institution seeking to be a “new kind of student-centered, urban university.”  The Sateren Professor is a two-thirds-time administrative leadership position with the expectation of teaching one course each semester.  This 10-month position offers a competitive salary commensurate with credentials and experience.  A dedicated discretionary fund will support expenses associated with developing, innovating, and representing Augsburg’s music programs.
 
A Progressive and Dynamic Department of Music, An Urban University, An Arts-Rich Community
Established in 1877, the Department of Music has an historic reputation for excellence, anchored by the Augsburg Choir.  Augsburg’s main campus is located near downtown Minneapolis, with ready access to the enormous range of cultural and artistic events and institutions for which the Twin Cities is known. The Twin Cities is a major metropolitan center featuring two world-class orchestras (the Minnesota Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra), leading semi-professional choirs and orchestras, and an expansive number of excellent church and community musicians and ensembles. The MacPhail Center for Music, several blocks from campus in the revived and thriving warehouse district that includes the nationally known Guthrie Theater, serves the largest number of intergenerational students of any community music school in the country. St. Paul is home to the American Composers Forum, the leading national professional organization for composers and new music, as well as the classical music presenting Schubert Club. 
The area is rich in diversity and the music of diverse peoples and is recognized as one of the leading philanthropic communities in the country. Jazz and popular music abound in clubs and concert venues, notably the nationally known Dakota Club and First Avenue. Chamber groups and new music are vital aspects of the music scene, notably through the cutting-edge Walker Art Center.  The Cedar Performing Arts Center, only two blocks from campus, is in the heart of the Twin Cities’ Somali community and presents internationally known musicians from diverse ethnic traditions. In addition to the Guthrie Theater, the “cities” are home to a large number of semi-professional and local community theater troupes. The downtown theater district in Minneapolis regularly features touring shows, as does the spectacular Ordway Center in downtown St. Paul. Guest artists of the renowned Schubert Club, the acclaimed Minnesota Opera, the two professional orchestras, and Vocalessence provide convenient and affordable access to critically regarded international performers, composers, and conductors. The department is a frequent beneficiary of lectures, collaborations, and short-term residencies due to the large number of widely known local, national, and international musicians to whom it has access.
 
Job Description
The Department of Music at Augsburg University
The University is demonstrably committed to supporting a 21st-century Department of Music that combines music reflective of a pluralistic society, an ethnically diverse student enrollment, and the civic engagement and leadership values of Augsburg University. Augsburg's Department of Music is primarily undergraduate, with majors and concentrations including music therapy (BS); music, human development, and learning (BMus); performance (BA), and music, media, and management (BA). There is also a liberal arts music degree (BA). Minors include liberal arts music, creativity, and music production.
Recently re-accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, the department offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Science degrees. The hybrid master’s degree in music therapy was recently ranked a top program in the country. There are currently about 145 undergraduate majors and 50 masters of music therapy students. The master’s degree in education offers opportunities for graduate coursework in music, human development, and learning. Many of Augsburg's students in majors other than music were active high school music participants and seek participation in music as university students. Approximately 150 students from other majors participate in music classes, lessons, and ensembles each year.
The department is housed in Anderson Music Hall (1978), which includes large and small rehearsal spaces, classrooms, a keyboard lab, a recently rebuilt recording studio, practice rooms and studios, a 225-seat recital hall, and faculty and staff offices. Hoversten Chapel, physically adjacent to Anderson Music Hall, serves as a performing space for major concerts and houses a 44-rank, 29-stop, mechanical action pipe organ built in 1989 by the Dobson Company. The department owns a well-maintained piano inventory as well as wind, string, and percussion instruments.
 
Augsburg University Music Department Distinctions
Since 2015, the department has undergone transformational change led by six new tenure-track faculty, three tenured faculty, two full-time contract faculty, the department chair, and a strong contingent of adjunct faculty. Approximately three million dollars in newly donated funds have supported scholarships. The department’s music-restricted endowed and demand funds currently stand at about $4 million.   
Distinctive aspects of the department include a fully renovated, state-of-art recording studio, an internationally recognized music therapy program taught by three full-time faculty members, and newly, progressively designed programs in creativity (composition/improvisation), and music production. The department recently initiated a university-community Global Harmony Chorus in collaboration with authentic musicians across the globe and orchestra/jazz exchanges with Latin American universities. The traditional two-semester music history sequence has been reconceptualized as global perspectives on music in social, cultural, and global context, and a new capstone course in creative career development has been recently been launched. The traditional “music education” program has been redesigned as Music, Human Development, and Learning, representing its two-track options in licensure for P-12 teaching as well as intergenerational community teaching and learning. In 2020, the department produced faculty member Reinaldo Moya’s immersive-experience opera, Tienda, focusing on immigrant issues in the Twin Cities in the 1930s, a work commissioned by the Schubert Club during his tenure as composer-in-residence for that organization.
 
Responsibilities of the Sateren Professor and Chair of Music: 
The University seeks a creative and visionary leader who will advance music's curricular alignment with university-wide priorities of social justice, urban education, diversity, and inclusion. The successful candidate will be a strategic partner for other stakeholders within the University in advancing our Augsburg mission. Advocating and advancing a curricular model that honors Augsburg's legacy of engaging music majors and students from across campus, the successful candidate will proactively engage with the wider music community in collaborations and partnerships and will participate enthusiastically in the department's goals of recruiting and nurturing diverse student participation throughout the department.

The SOIS is led by a Director of the School of Information Studies, and the faculty includes eleven full-time tenure-track faculty members.

Consistent with the diversity of Queens, 56 percent of LaGuardia students are born outside of the United States.

LIVING IN THE AREA:

CSUMB is the closest CSU to the beach, just one mile from the
Pacific Ocean and its beautiful sandy shores. The Monterey Bay area
enjoys temperate weather all year round and abundant opportunities
for outdoor recreation such as kayaking, surfing, hiking, golfing,
and mountain biking. Minutes away from amazing natural wonders
including Big Sur and Point Lobos, as well as world-famous
destinations like Cannery Row, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and
Pebble Beach, the campus is also close to the Salinas Valley, Santa
Cruz, Silicon Valley, and the San Francisco Bay area.

Adjacent to campus, Fort Ord National Monument encompasses 14,000
protected acres located on the former Fort Ord military base. The
land includes more than 80 miles of trails for hiking, horseback
riding, mountain biking, and watching wildlife in their natural
habitat. It's home to 44 species of rare plants and animals. Trails
are open daily from dawn to dusk and run through a range of
environments, from grassy hills to coastal shrubland.

CSUMB is just minutes away from some of the most beautiful scenic
areas and amazing natural wonders in the world. The Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary, the largest of its kind in the United
States, includes 276 miles of shoreline and protects one of the
world's most diverse marine ecosystems. Inhabitants include deep
sea anglerfish, dolphins, whales and CSUMB's mascot, the sea
otter.

College of Science students have opportunities like none other
because of the proximity to the extraordinary living laboratory of
Monterey Bay. The university offers one of the only diving programs
in the country with entry through leadership-level diving
certifications, as well as scientific research operations.

About 30 miles south of campus, just off Highway 1, lies the
majestic stretch of land known as Big Sur. Bordered by the Santa
Lucia Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Big Sur “offers unmatched
scenic beauty and is famous for its breathtaking coastline,
towering redwoods and epic hiking trails,” according to the
Monterey County Convention and Visitors Bureau.

CSUMB sits halfway between the Monterey Peninsula, with the coastal
communities of Pacific Grove, Monterey, Seaside and Carmel, and the
Salinas Valley, known as the ""Salad Bowl of the World"" for its
abundant agricultural production.

Less than 10 miles from campus, the city of Monterey dazzles with
iconic attractions and famous landmarks. Places like Cannery Row
and Old Fisherman's Wharf, which inspired John Steinbeck's novels,
and the Monterey Bay Aquarium draw visitors from around the
world.

Take a two-hour drive north to reach San Francisco, one of the most
visited cities in the world. San Francisco brims with history,
museums, famous attractions, and landmarks including the Golden
Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, Chinatown, and historic cable
cars.

campus-wide effort launched by the top-tier research university in
2022 to create an intellectual hub for a just and livable future.
The Department of Architecture is part of the School of
Architecture & Environment in the College of Design and has
been recognized as a leader in the field of sustainability since
the 1960s, offering B.Arch., M.Arch., M.S. degrees and a Ph.D. in
Sustainable Design. . It examines how design of the physical
environment can repair the natural environment, regenerate
communities and elevate the human spirit. Broad societal challenges
are addressed through the lens of specific clients, locations and
ecosystems. Established in 1914, the UO School of Architecture and
Allied Arts was one of the first to break away from Beaux-Arts
pedagogy to emphasize non-competitive, individualized education.
Faculty are committed to creating a student-centered learning
community that embraces multiple viewpoints. It is a department in
which learning, research, and professional activity inform each
other; in which new ideas and established traditions are in
dialogue.

The College of Design's unique academic ecosystem includes diverse
disciplines to engage complex problems such as designing for all
life-forms. It comprises not only creative
practitioners—architects, artists and designers—but also social
scientists, humanities scholars, engineers, economists, biologists,
planners, and policy makers. The School of Architecture &
Environment includes the Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and
Interior Architecture departments on the University's Eugene,
Oregon main campus. The campus is located about 65 miles from the
Pacific coast and the Cascade mountains and 110 miles south of
Portland. With visionary leadership in urban design and
transportation policies, the Portland branch campus is the urban
laboratory for the Department of Architecture and the Historic
Preservation program. Both Portland and Eugene are
socially-progressive, bike-friendly, healthy, green, and
family-friendly cities with ambitious goals for carbon emissions
reduction and for community wellbeing. For more information on the
school and department, please visit: https://archenvironment.uoregon.edu/

In 2019, Oregon was the first to pass a statewide mandate to
increase housing choices by allowing forms of multi-family housing
on previously single-family residential lots. Leadership is needed
to show how the resulting 2022 housing code changes can benefit
communities regionally and globally. This position builds on the UO
Graduate Housing Specialization that was recognized with a National
Honor Award for Housing Design Education given by Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) and the American
Institute of Architects (AIA) in 2016. and on the department's
stature in sustainable, healthy, and just built environments.

The successful candidate will support and enhance a diverse
learning and working environment. We particularly welcome
applications from scholars who are from groups historically
underrepresented in the academy, and/or who have experience working
with populations from historically and persistently underserved
communities. To broaden perspectives and conversations, the School
of Architecture welcomed its first cohort of Design for Spatial
Justice Fellows in September 2019 and the College of Design's
Diversity Fellow is charged with implementing the College's
Diversity Action Plan. The University of Oregon has set forth a

the University of Oregon, to the land we now call Oregon, and to
the world.

The Dell Medical School Department of Psychiatry and

in Austin, Texas.

The Dell Medical School, the first new medical school to be built
at a tier one research university in nearly fifty years, welcomed
its inaugural class in 2016. The school is committed to redesigning
academic medicine and revolutionizing how people get and stay
healthy, by educating leaders, developing new models of care, and
advancing innovation from health products to health care delivery.
The Seton Healthcare Family is a member of Ascension Health, the
largest not-for-profit health network in the nation.

Austin has been designated by US News & World Report as one of
the top ten “Best Places to Live” for several years. This growing
metropolis is considered “the live music capital of the world,” a
high-tech growth hub, and home to one of the largest state
universities in the country.

We seek a physician with a multicultural approach to psychiatric
care who will help our Department and the WRMH achieve our goal of

The psychiatrist provides consultation, initial evaluations and
follow-up treatment for women struggling with mental health issues
in a collaborative, multi-disciplinary and team-oriented approach.
Depending on leadership skills, the candidate may progress to

lives. Clinical assignments will occur in our clinic at the

School and through our Department's collaboration with the Seton
Healthcare Family, with the physician providing clinical care
primarily in an outpatient setting, though inpatient consultation
may also be required.

The successful candidate's appointment within the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavior Sciences at Dell Medical School requires
regular participation in educational activities with fellows,
residents, medical students and other trainees. In addition, the
physician will have the opportunity for collaboration that allows
for the pursuit of innovative clinical programming, educational,
and research initiatives.

Essential Duties and Responsibilities

Provide culturally-informed clinical care to women proximate to
child-bearing and other reproductive life events unique to women,
extending the WRMH's outreach to underserved communities in
Texas.

clinical care and ensure equitable access to care for all
ethnicities and cultures in Texas.
Teach fellows, residents, medical students, and other trainees
in addition to implementing novel training programs pertinent to
reproductive psychiatry in a multicultural context.
Develop and foster an atmosphere of scientific and academic
inquiry in conjunction with trainees and researchers within the
multidisciplinary team.
Conduct scholarly work, an expectation of all Dell Medical
School faculty. Examples of scholarly work include, but are not
limited to, publishing work in high-impact journals, presenting
work at national and international meetings, and working with care
providers and health care delivery networks to implement research
in practice.
Facilitate research initiatives, such as, participant
recruitment, conduction of clinical research, and dissemination of
new learning and innovations.
Collaborate with other schools at The University of Texas at
Austin and across The University of Texas system.
Actively participate in the activities of the Department of

Departmental policies.
