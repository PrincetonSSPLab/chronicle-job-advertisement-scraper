37339891,Three Design Faculty Positions Starting in Fall 2023,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37339891/three-design-faculty-positions-starting-in-fall-2023/,False,The School of Design,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",All positions include a comprehensive benefits package and a competitive salary.,2022-10-12,"We are a community of individuals united by a shared belief in Design's power to lead the transition to more just, equitable futures for people and planet. Our vision is collective, with each member of our school representing a vital part of the whole. We are engaged in constant debate surrounding Design’s role and purpose in envisioning, rebuilding, and recrafting the worlds we want. But who is the “we,” and who gets to decide what is “wanted?” Indeed, we believe bad design disproportionately harms the most marginalized people, places, and ecosystems. For good design to happen, we must center these underrepresented individuals and groups within our community, culture, and work. As one of North America's oldest, most esteemed design schools, we believe our story is inspiring yet unfinished. Join us in writing the next chapter.
Areas of focus
We are looking for a cohort of three, dynamic faculty to advance thinking on Design’s contemporary role and purpose. The ideal candidates will have strong design underpinnings in making and critical thinking and show enthusiasm and promise in design-led research, creative practice, and teaching at undergraduate and graduate levels. We hope to hear from candidates who are keen to advise graduate students at the masters and/or PhD levels, and work within one or more of the following areas:

Data visualization, information design systems, and media literacy
Digital prototyping and UI/UX research and practice
Tangible interactions for objects and material experiences
Hand-making, craft processes, and commercial-scale production
Interaction design for physical, digital, and hybrid environments
Prototyping for smart environments and extended-reality

Expectations of the role

Teach classes across all levels of the undergraduate and graduate programs
Advise Masters’ students and possibly PhD researchers in Transition Design
Be familiar with critical issues that are social, technological, political, environmental, and/or economic in nature
Commit to building a culture of equity, inclusion, and belonging through teaching, research, creative practice, and service
Exhibit strong leadership and a commitment to team working

Desired experience & qualifications
Excellence in academic contexts comes in many forms, is built over time, and stems from life experiences. We embrace a diversity of approaches and are eager to work with people who are passionate about teaching, learning, and working with us to shape the future of Design. We believe the following to be important:

A terminal degree in a design-related field (e.g., Master of Design, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Architecture, and/or PhD) or equivalent professional experience
University-level teaching experience in Design—full-time, adjunct, TA—at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels
Professional design and/or community engagement experience (such as leadership, mentoring, volunteering)

Position options 
Assistant or Associate Tenure-Track
In addition to teaching four classes per academic year, tenure-track faculty are expected to produce research, scholarly work, artistic work, and/or engage in design practice that elevates the field. Examples of faculty activities include but are not limited to: participation in practice-based research, professional activities, exhibitions; work published, in print or online, in academic journals, and/or trade publications; invited talks/workshops at notable national and international venues; patents held; items in production or collections; grants and sponsored research; professional honors and awards; and significant contributions to professional societies and organizations. 
Assistant or Associate Teaching-Track
In place of research, teaching-track faculty take on an additional two courses, for a total of six courses per academic year. Teaching-track faculty also frequently participate in freelance or consultancy work or other external professional activities that inform and continually advance their teaching. 
All positions include a comprehensive benefits package and a competitive salary. 
Application package 
Interested individuals should include the following in their application package:

2. If applying for a tenure-track position, a one-page “research statement” that describes the topics you aim to investigate and their potential contribution to the field of Design. Please also include links to any relevant publications, research proposals, and evidence of funding.
3. A full CV, including your academic qualifications, work experience, list of notable research and/or professional outputs, technical skills and competencies, and/or examples of community engagement work.

Preferred Qualifications
In addition to the required qualifications noted above, the search will give preference to applicants who are able to provide evidence of the following:   Administration: Candidates should be able to exhibit success in previous or current administrative roles, whether within the university or the discipline.

a competitive start-up package and salary based on 36-weeks of
service annually, which can be supplemented with additional salary
up to a total of 48 weeks from external competitive grants and
contracts and/or from endowment funds.

Research has indicated that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be
effective in disease prevention and management. Precision health
aims to incorporate individual characteristics, lifestyle, and
environment to optimize health. Precision health is inclusive of
precision medicine and precision public health, and in the context
of nutrition, has been highlighted as an NIH priority with the
creation of the Nutrition for Precision Health initiative under the
All of Us program. Biopsychosocial models contribute to the
interindividual variation of nutrition interventions—these
variations contribute to health inequities. Precision nutrition
asserts that these relationships are bidirectional, with complex
links to genomic, metabolomic, social, psychological, dietary, and
environmental components. We will consider applicants whose
research includes animal models and/or human research. Applicants
will be expected to maintain a successful research program and to
teach in the Department's undergraduate and graduate programs.

About the Huck Institutes of Life Sciences

The Huck Institutes might best be imagined as a web—or maybe as a
series of bridges, built and maintained by dedicated researchers,
between various University institutions that would have otherwise
been isolated islands. The more these bridges are built up, the
better we get at communicating and collaborating across the life
sciences, and the better we get at solving problems and having real
impacts on science and society.

For this position, the key Huck Institute units and initiatives we
would expect a precision nutrition hire to collaborate with groups
such as:

Microbiome Center (with >100 faculty from 10
colleges)
Metabolomics expertise, with recent investment, instrumentation
and faculty expertise across several colleges to handle
population-level initiatives on diet, metabolism and health
outcomes, not least in disadvantaged populations
Center for Medical Genomics/Genome Sciences Institute, where we
have world-leading faculty in statistics and genomics, including
precision genomics initiative as part of University Health Science
Council biomedical initiative
Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and/or Center for
Molecular Immunology and Infectious Diseases, where there is
expertise in inflammation and global health



This hire would also contribute to growing faculty expertise in the
Intercollege Graduate Degree Program in Neuroscience,
Bioinformatics and Genomics, Physiology, or Molecular, Cellular and
Integrative Biosciences.

Assistant Professor

North Carolina Central University
 Closing Date: at 11:55 PM

Primary Purpose of Position:
The Department of Criminal Justice is seeking applications to fill
one nine-month tenure-track position (610753) at the Assistant
Professor level starting the Fall 2023 academic year. The selected
candidate will be expected to teach a full course load (a minimum
of 12 credit hours per semester), to include course instructions
that achieve student learning outcomes, annual scholarly outputs,
and engage in significant service with the Department and
University Community

Criminal Justice is the largest undergraduate program at NCCU, and
it is projected to grow at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
This position is essential to the department's efforts to support
all undergraduate programs (face-to-face, online and site based
campus) and the graduate program, a priority of both the University
and department. We are exploring implementing Hyflex options for
course delivery at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Hyflex
will allow students to learn where they are as this modality allow
students to attend class synchronously in person or online and
asynchronously by watching recorded synchronous lectures on their
own time. The Hyflex modality will allow the degrees in criminal
justice to be more accessible especially at the graduate level,
which will generate the need for additional resources.

The vacancy of this position (610753) will place a significant
burden on the Department and faculty. This position is critical to
the mission of the Department of Criminal Justice and the
University's efforts to promote student success (i.e., retention
and graduation) at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Moreover,
lacking a qualified person in this tenure-track Assistant Professor
position will limit the productivity of the unit in regards to
producing peer-reviewed scholarship and securing externally-funded
projects. These two things are related as grant funding agencies
base their funding decisions in part on the evidence of competence
by the prospective researcher/investigative team or unit (i.e., the
Department). Lacking qualified tenured/tenure-track faculty
jeopardizes our recertification, and limits our ability to obtain
additional certifications (e.g., ACJS Certification of our graduate
program). The vacancy created by this departure, which is a
significant component of our curriculum, a professional area of
interest among students, and is a major area of research and
potential external funding. Furthermore, the lost faculty member
was an important anchor to our instruction in the area of research
methodology, which is a significant component of our undergraduate
and graduate curricula. Efforts to hire new faculty will focus on
the aforementioned gaps, extramural funding and related
instructional/research areas.

Minimum Education/Experience:
A doctorate in Criminal Justice or a closely related discipline
from an accredited institution is required. Applicants must have at
least 18 Doctoral-level hours in Criminal Justice or related
discipline. A Juris Doctorate does not qualify for the position.
ABD candidates will be considered. Degree must be conferred by May
2023

Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
Responsibilities will include teaching undergraduate and graduate
level courses through face-to-face and online instruction, engage
in curriculum development and assessment at the graduate and
undergraduate levels, and advise/mentor students for graduate-level
thesis and projects. As a tenure-track faculty member, faculty must
engage in peer-reviewed scholarship to meet the requirements for
promotion and tenure, and to meet the goals and objectives of the
University, College, and the Department. This includes
participation in externally-funded research activities (i.e.,
grants), particularly in conjunction with the Department’s two
institutes: The Institute for Homeland Security and Workforce
Development and the Juvenile Justice Institute. The person must
also engage in significant service within the Department and
University Community, and their respective academic/professional
disciplines. The ability to work independently as well as
collegially with others to ensure student learning and success in a
diverse environment is expected. Excellent oral and written
communication skills are required.
Preferences for this position:
All areas of specialization will be considered. Individuals with
teaching specialization in Law Enforcement are encouraged to
apply.

Special Instructions to Applicants:
Finalist will be required to submit an official transcript and
submit to a background investigation. Candidates are required to
upload their Letters of Recommendation prior to submitting their
applications.

school districts for field placements and is engaged in residency
and co-teaching models for student teaching in many of the

About the University:

California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) opened in 2002

Since that time, the University has grown and developed into one of
the premier public universities, not only in the California State
University system, but also in the nation. Indeed, U.S. News &
World Report listed CSUCI as 20th among “Top Public Schools” in its
2021 edition of Best Colleges Rankings. In 2020, CollegeNET also
ranked CSUCI 20th out of over 1,449 schools in its “Social Mobility
Index,” and Money Magazine rated CSUCI as the 15th “Most
Transformative College” in the nation.

CSUCI is a public comprehensive university that engages students in
critical inquiry and is dedicated to educating leaders for a global
society. The University is located in Ventura County and is home to
more than 6,900 undergraduate and 239 graduate students.
Approximately 55% of CSUCI's students are Pell Grant eligible, and

also proud to be designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution
(HSI), with 55% of its undergraduate students self-identifying as
Latinx, 25% as White, 6% as Asian/Asian American, 4% as
multiracial, and 2% as Black/African American. In 2019, CSUCI was
awarded Excelencia in Education's inaugural “Seal of Excelencia”
for its facilitation of Latinx student success.

CSUCI is committed to diversifying its faculty in order to address
students' ever-changing needs in the 21st century. The University
is also taking steps to confront racism and to advocate for social
justice. To this end, CSUCI encourages applicants to apply who are
motivated to serve and contribute to the university's tenure-track
body, which self-identifies as 62% White, 21% Latinx, 9%

CSUCI's Commitment to You:

CSUCI is committed to helping newly hired faculty develop a sense
of belonging in a collaborative and supportive community dedicated
to providing resources and opportunities for establishing and
sustaining a research agenda and engaging in continuous improvement
in equitable teaching and learning.

About the Program:

The School of Education builds from the foundations of the
undergraduate Liberal Studies option in Teaching & Learning,
the undergraduate Early Childhood Studies program, and academic
majors in biology, English, mathematics, history, and social
studies, and extends to the Master of Arts in Education. SOE's
programs contribute to the education profession by producing
teachers and school administrators who believe that all students
can achieve high standards, who adapt their teaching to reach all
students and who embrace the diversity of all students. These
graduates are reflective about their teaching, their attitudes, and
their ability to work in collaborative analytical teams. SOE
strives to prepare educators to uplift, inspire, and engage all
students, families, and communities with whom they work and works
to advance issues of equity, diversity, inclusion,
teaching/educating for justice, and accessibility.

SOE has approximately 15 full-time faculty, 55 part-time faculty,
14 staff, and over 600 students. Undergraduate degree programs are
offered in Early
Childhood
Studies and Liberal Studies with emphases in Teaching and
Learning and 
Concentrated Studies. The accredited post-baccalaureate
credential programs prepare students to be elementary,
secondary,
and/or special
education teachers with an option to earn a bilingual
authorization. SOE has partnerships and MOUs with many local
school districts for field placements and is engaged in residency
and co-teaching models for student teaching in many of the
credential programs.

SOE currently offers two master's degrees: an MA in Educational
Leadership with emphases in P-12 and Higher Education and an MA
in Education with emphases in Curriculum and Instruction and
Disability Studies. Licensure for the school administrator's
credential is offered with courses closely aligned to the P-12
emphasis in the MA in Educational Leadership. A Credential Office,
Field Placement Office, Graduate Studies Center, and the California
Physical Education Health Project currently report to the Dean of
the School of Education.

The School of Education is actively involved in sponsored research
and activities and manages federal, state, and system grants.
Funding sources and activities include: the Bechtel Foundation,
Early Assessment Program, California Teachers Summit, Math and
Science Teacher Initiative, Federal TEACH grants, Chancellor's
Doctorate Initiative Program, and the Sally Casanova Pre-Doctoral
Program. The School is accredited by the California Commission on

To teach English, French or Spanish, candidates must have at least 18 graduate hours in those languages. With a teaching load of 3-1-3, faculty teach one course during our January term, or “Interim,” which provides opportunities for faculty and students to apply more experiential learning of non-traditional topics, including domestic and international travel.

The candidate will advise first-year students at the college beginning in their second year, engage in committee work, advise German majors and minors, as well as develop and participate in extracurricular activities to enrich the German program and to attract and retain students. Preference will be given to candidates who demonstrate self-motivation, creativity in designing and implementing new courses, and an interest or experience in community outreach. Applicants should demonstrate a willingness to actively contribute to and collaborate with the German program, the Department of Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures, and Wofford College as a whole.
Because Wofford College is committed to building and supporting a diverse educational environment, we invite applicants to include a passage in their teaching philosophy statement that articulates how their experiences or future efforts would contribute to both the department and campus, fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment (see #5 below under “Application”).

We received a CSU Teagle Grant to explore an anti-racist approach for developing a student-centered curriculum. As a result of these initiatives, our students and faculty are positioning themselves to lead and support an equal, diverse, and inclusive vision for the global future of landscape architecture within the complex, diverse, transforming ecologies and culture of our Southern California context.

OR the equivalent*

All coursework must be from a recognized accredited college or
university. If you have competed your education at an institution
outside of the United States, please see the section below titled
“Foreign Transcripts” for additional information.

*EQUIVALENCY

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to
select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:

Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.

Candidate's transcripts state: “Master's degree in agricultural
science”.

Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in the example do
not EXACTLY MATCH the degree listed in the minimum
qualifications section, this candidate MUST complete the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) in order to be
considered. When completing the form, be sure to explain in detail
how your qualifications are equivalent to the required minimum
qualifications. Do not assume that you do not need to submit a
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency because your degree is
similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

intimidation. With this commitment as well as a commitment to
addressing all forms of academic misconduct, UCLA conducts targeted
employment reference checks for finalists to whom departments or
other hiring units would like to extend formal offers of
appointment into Academic Senate faculty positions. The targeted
employment reference checks involve contacting the finalists'
current and prior places of employment to ask whether there have
been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the
University's Faculty Code of Conduct. To implement this process,
UCLA requires all applicants for Academic Senate faculty positions
to complete, sign, and upload the form entitled “Authorization to

Have evidence of experience teaching in P-12 education. Demonstrate expertise in teaching and/or scholarship focused on culturally and linguistically responsive assessments and/or instruction. This work should focus on learners with and without disabilities who are bilingual and/or learning a second language in P-12 education. This expertise should demonstrate the unique ways in which language, culture, identity, and disability intersect and influence teaching and learning. Be able to demonstrate oral proficiency in the English language as a requirement for this position, as mandated by state law.

The Department of Special Education/College of Education (SED/COE) has built a strong reputation for scholarly work in the field of education as the fourth largest producer of teachers in the nation boasting a pool of approximately 40 tenure and non-tenure track faculty in the department of special education. The department enrolls approximately 700 undergraduate and 150 graduate students each year across seven different majors in special education. The College of Education hosts three Departments including: Educational Administration and Foundation (EAF), Teaching and Learning (TCH), and Special Education. The College of Education is well positioned for research and school collaborations with easy access to both urban and rural districts with additional opportunities for research in the university-supported K12 laboratory school. For more information about our program visit: Department of Special Education.
 
As one of the largest producers of teachers in the nation, ISU is positioned at the crossroads of urban and rural communities with a need to produce teachers who can serve in a variety of settings. Our department has an immense responsibility to produce high quality teachers that can meet the diverse needs of students today. One area of importance is meeting the needs of students who are bilingual and with special needs. Research shows that these students have a critical need for support that can be mediated by highly trained professionals. Therefore, we desire to find faculty with expertise and a deep understanding of the issues faced by this population. For example, research shows that programming must prepare special education candidates so that they are well equipped to address the needs of monolingual/monocultural students with disabilities. Further, programming must emphasize language development for bi/multilingual and bi/multicultural students with and without disabilities. Therefore, to serve emergent bilingual students with disabilities, our special education candidates must possess skills and knowledge to attend to unique ways in which language, culture, identity, and disability intersect and influence teaching and learning especially in the early childhood years. Another dimension of effective practice in bilingual/ESL special education relates to knowledge about language and linguistics. Research and professional organizations have identified proficiency in two or more language/dialects, abilities to assess language development within and across languages/dialects, and knowledge of second language acquisition theories. Finally, we desire to strengthen our faculty expertise to meet recently described competencies for all literacy teachers who serve emergent bilingual students who have, or are at risk for, language and/or literacy related disability difficulties. These include understanding developmental stages of literacy and biliteracy, valuing and promoting bilingualism/biliteracy, and recognizing the influences of organizational cultures on teaching and learning.

37335827,Assistant Professor of Finance,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/37335827/assistant-professor-of-finance/,False,Boston University,"Boston, Massachusetts",Competitive,2022-10-06,"The Questrom School of Business at Boston University invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Finance. The Finance Department seeks to add to its vibrant community of talented scholars who work in areas at the cutting edge of today’s research in asset pricing, corporate finance, governance and strategy, and risk management. The anticipated start date for this position is July 1, 2023.
Finance scholarship is often seen as promoting the objective of maximum investor and shareholder value to the exclusion of all other goals and at the expense of all other stakeholders. To the contrary, modern finance scholarship is also concerned with identifying complementarities between financial metrics and social values while recognizing some inevitable tradeoffs between the two objectives. Finance research is in a strong position to investigate a number of key questions. How do the firm’s actions affect multiple players – shareholders, customers, workers, affected third parties – for better or worse? To what degree are the management actions transparent and/or ethical? Do the firm’s actions generate predictable negative (or positive) externalities, and how should these be remedied? For instance, private firms and markets often work at odds with environmental sustainability, economic equality, and the long-run welfare of future generations. The department is seeking a faculty hire whose work illuminates these questions and issues. Besides research, this faculty member is expected to coordinate with the Susilo institute to help develop a curriculum in line with the sustainability initiative of the university and Questrom’s aspiration to be a leader in ESG teaching and research. Applicants should be able to teach at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
The Finance department believes that the cultural and social diversity of our faculty, staff, and students is vitally important to the distinction and excellence of our research and academic programs. To that, we are especially eager to have join our ranks a colleague who supports our institutional commitment to ensuring BU is inclusive, equitable, diverse, and a place where all constituents can thrive. The Questrom School of Business seeks to continue diversifying our faculty, student and staff ranks, recognizing that diversity of experience and thought deepens the intellectual endeavor. Boston University is an institution with a rich tradition dedicated to inclusion and social justice. We are proud that we were the first American University to award a Ph.D. to a woman and of our record of inclusiveness.
Applicants must possess, or be near completion of, a PhD in Finance or a related field by the start of employment. Salary will be competitive and commensurate with experience.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
Applications should submit a cover letter, a complete curriculum vitae, three reference letters, and up to three recent publications or working papers in electronic (PDF) format to https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/22695. Applications will be accepted until December 1, 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis. To ensure full consideration, candidates are encouraged to apply early.

Position Description


The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-
and-engineering) at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)
invites applications for positions at the Assistant and Associate
Professor levels. We seek to hire up to three candidates with a
strong background in computer science and engineering, with a
particular focus on storage systems and databases. We are
especially interested in candidates who can collaborate within the
department and across the university.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is part of the
Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Our school has
nationally and internationally known researchers in many areas,
including theoretical computer science, programming languages,
security, distributed systems, storage systems, computer
architectures, machine learning, natural language processing,
vision, VLSI, and networking. The Baskin School of Engineering is
home to six departments, contributing to the richness of its
research. Nestled in a redwood forest above the city of Santa Cruz,
our beautiful campus has a long history of embracing groundbreaking
interdisciplinary work. Our campus is the nearest University of
California campus to Silicon Valley and has close research ties
with the local computer industry. Our proximity to Silicon Valley,
and our satellite campus there, afford opportunities and avenues
for collaboration with researchers working in the many research and
development labs in Silicon Valley, as well as with the other San
Francisco Bay Area universities.

UC Santa Cruz values diversity, equity, and inclusion and is
committed to hiring faculty who will work to support these values.
UC Santa Cruz is a Minority-serving Institution (MSI) with a high
proportion of first-in-family students. To be considered,
candidates must demonstrate an understanding of the barriers facing
women, people of color, and other groups underrepresented in
engineering, as well as describe their experience and future plans
to promote equity and inclusion in teaching, mentoring, and
research. Efforts supporting equity and inclusion at UC Santa Cruz
will be recognized as important during the merit review and
promotion process. The selected candidates will receive a start-up
package that includes funding in support of furthering Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion efforts.

The successful candidates are expected to develop a research
program, advise graduate students in their research area, obtain
external funding, develop and teach courses within the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum, perform university, public
and professional service, and interact broadly with the large
number of researchers in Silicon Valley industrial research and
advanced development labs. The successful candidates should be able
to work with students, faculty, and staff from various social and
cultural backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations.

UC Santa Cruz is a member of the Association of American
Universities (AAU, an association of the top research universities
in the US), a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), a member of the
Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Research Universities (HRSU), a member
of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI),
an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving
Institution (AANAPISI), and a member of several identity and ethnic
affinity professional societies. Broadening participation in
engineering, and equitably and inclusively serving underrepresented
minoritized students are key values at UC Santa Cruz. More
information can be found: https://apo.ucsc.edu/diversity.html

The chosen candidates will be expected to sign a statement
representing that they are not the subject of any ongoing
investigation or disciplinary proceeding at their current academic
institution or place of employment, nor have they in the past ten
years been formally disciplined at any academic institution/place
of employment. In the event the candidates cannot make this
representation, they will be expected to disclose in writing to the
hiring Dean the circumstances surrounding any formal discipline
that they have received, as well as any current or ongoing
investigation or disciplinary process of which they are the
subject. (Note that discipline includes a negotiated settlement
agreement to resolve a matter related to substantiated
misconduct.)

professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through

TRACK

SUMMARY OF POSITION:
Since 1890, Whitworth University, a private, residential,
comprehensive liberal arts institution affiliated with the
Presbyterian church, has held fast to its founding mission to
provide its students an education of mind and heart characterized
by rigorous and open intellectual inquiry and the integration of
Christian faith and learning. Anchored in the Reformed tradition
and enriched throughout its history by strong evangelical and
ecumenical currents, Whitworth's mission is carried out by a
diverse community of dedicated Christian scholars and staff members
who are called to a variety of vocations to serve and support
students. Whitworth believes the best learning occurs in the
context of relationships – inside and outside of the classroom –
where professors and staff members invest in the lives of students.
Whitworth is committed to modeling the highest standards of
integrity and fairness and being a trusted and valued member of the
community.

DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING & PHYSICS:
The mission of the Department of Engineering & Physics is to
provide our students with an academically rigorous education in
physics and its application to engineering. This takes place in a
context of committed Christian faith, intellectual challenge, and
holistic mentoring. We seek to prepare students for careers in
which they will explore the laws of the natural world that God has
made, share the details of that creation with others, and apply
technology to serve the needs of the world.

The department currently has six tenured or tenure-track faculty
members and graduates 15-20 undergraduate students each year. We
currently offer an ABET-accredited B.S. in Engineering, a B.S. in

opportunities for our students. Alternatively, a candidate could
pursue more traditional academic research resulting in
peer-reviewed and publicly-disseminated publications. A startup
package will be provided to help support candidates interested in
establishing such a research program, but candidates should
demonstrate the initiative necessary to leverage this to receive
external funding, with the support of Whitworth's Sponsored
Program's Office.

Participation in departmental activities, academic advising,
faculty governance, service to the profession, and service to the
community is expected.

OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
This position also offers the possibility of developing new courses
that contribute to the university's interdisciplinary Shared
Curriculum. Additional responsibilities include participation in
departmental activities and governance, professional and research

Department:

Cura personalis, or the care for and growth of the whole
person, which informs not just how we teach our teachers, but also
how we expect our teachers to engage their own K-12 students;
social justice, or the pursuit of educational equity through
the preparation of teachers who deliver culturally relevant and
sustaining pedagogy that helps all students learn;
transformation through the development of our students into
equity-oriented teachers and agents of change; and diversity
of faculty and students, who enrich K-12 schools, our teacher
preparation program and scholarly research through their critical
voices and perspectives.

Our teacher preparation program (MATTC) faculty have re-written and
re-imagined our teacher preparation program to embrace a fully
inclusive model of education that will result in students'
eligibility for a dual credential (General Education and Special
Education). Our aim is to ensure all educators are prepared for the
learning needs and neuro-diversity present in every classroom.
(NOTE: The Educational Specialist Credential is under review and we
anticipate approval in the coming months). Our Department of

partnerships. Faculty teach courses at Santa Clara University's
main campus and our East San José campus, which hosts several K-12
schools serving students from an underserved and culturally rich
Latinx neighborhood.

to actively carry it out in each facet of the position.

Advanced Assistant Professor in the area of Special Education to
lead the Educational Specialist credential program and to serve as
a tenured (or near tenured) member of our Department of Education.

research related to Special Education. Area of specialization

to educate students with learning differences and neurodiverse
students. Experience teaching in K-12 schools is preferred, but not
required.

We seek candidates with experience working in racially, ethnically,
linguistically, and economically diverse schools and communities,
particularly through school-university partnerships. Although not
required, candidates who would have an interest in connecting to
our Latinx Research Center or who have some expertise in working in
schools with large emerging bilingual populations should address
this interest in their cover letter.

QUALIFICATIONS

The successful candidate will satisfy all of the following
requirements:

Earned PhD in Education or related field.
Outstanding teacher and a strong commitment to teaching and the
preparation of the next generation of teachers.
Proven success for accomplishment in scholarship, commensurate
with the tenure expectations of a university committed to a

anti-racism and a just and sustainable world.

education classrooms and roles.

About the College/Department:
Eastern Kentucky University is a regional, coeducational, public
institution of higher education offering general and liberal arts
programs, pre-professional and professional training in education
and various other fields at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels. Located in Richmond, Madison County, Kentucky, EKU has a
distinguished record of more than a century of educational service
to the Commonwealth. Eastern Kentucky University is committed to
access, equal opportunity, dignity, respect, and inclusion for all
people, as integral to a learning environment in which intellectual
creativity and diversity thrives.

Situated near the heart of the Bluegrass, Richmond is served by a
network of major highways that make EKU easily accessible from all
parts of Kentucky and surrounding states. Richmond is 26 miles
southeast of Lexington, Kentucky. Interstate Highways I-75
(north-south) and I-64 (east-west) make the metropolitan areas of
Cincinnati, 112 miles to the north, and Louisville, 110 miles to
the west, within convenient distance by automobile. Richmond is
also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and
Kentucky Route 52 from the east and west. The Bluegrass, Mountain,
Daniel Boone, and Cumberland Parkways provide even greater
accessibility by automobile since the city is located near the
convergence of these arterial highways into the interstate
system.

EKU is dedicated to high-quality instruction, scholarship, and
service, and places emphasis on the three in that order. Through
its colleges and schools, the University seeks to offer quality
instruction at a variety of degree levels in general education, the
arts, the sciences, business, education, pre-professional and
professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through
consultative services, continuing education, and the extended
campus, the University seeks to provide service to the community
and the region. Research seeks both to advance knowledge in the
subject matter areas with which the University is concerned and to
support the primary function of teaching.

EKU’s Department of Biological Sciences (https://biology.eku.edu/) includes a
robust group of more than 25 full-time faculty who work
collaboratively among themselves and with other departments and
colleges at EKU. The department engages in both basic and applied
research, and faculty have access to state-of-the-art biomedical
research suites (constructed in 2017) with a wide range of
scientific equipment allowing research from cellular to whole
animal levels. Partnerships with R1 universities in the region
afford our faculty and students access to molecular core
facilities.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
The College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign invites applications for faculty positions in sustainability and climate, with primary responsibilities in the college's Department of Urban and Regional Planning. We seek new colleagues who conduct innovative, interdisciplinary, and collaborative research on critical dimensions of sustainability and climate, particularly racial equity, community resilience and environmental justice. We welcome applicants from a wide range of fields focused on climate and sustainability as they intersect core planning concerns of land use, environment, transportation, community development, economic development, and design, both in the U.S. and internationally.
DURP currently has 14 full-time faculty members in addition to its adjunct and affiliate faculty, 99 students in the BAUSP program, 58 students in the MUP program, and 16 Ph.D. students. Its curricular offerings span sustainable design and development, community development for social justice, local and regional economic development, and environment and land use, and transportation concentrations, as well as a cross cutting transnational planning specialization. The university (www.illinois.edu) and departmental (www.urban.illinois.edu) web sites offer additional information.
While these positions will be based in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, there is potential for cross-appointments in the college's Department of Landscape Architecture or School of Architecture, or in the university's excellent area and ethnic studies departments across African American Studies, American Indian Studies, Latina/Latino Studies, and more. Accordingly, we invite applications from a wide range of fields, especially urban planning, urban studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, urban ecology, and indigenous, ethnic and racial studies. We are open to all methodological approaches, ranging from data science and analytics to ethnography to community-engaged research and decolonial approaches.
In 2013, the Department of Urban and Regional Planning celebrated one hundred years of planning education at Illinois and has an international reputation for training professional planners and developing future scholars. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a land grant R1 institution. DURP is a unit of the College of Fine and Applied Arts, which provides opportunities for collaboration with scholars, practitioners, and artists, and which also provides opportunities for outreach and engagement via the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts and the Krannert Art Museum.
The campus and the Department provide ample support for faculty to conduct interdisciplinary research and innovative teaching. Members of the DURP faculty are involved in a broad array of ongoing research and public engagement activities throughout Illinois, the U.S., and internationally. In addition to DURP's home in the College of Fine and Applied Arts, the position offers many potential connections in the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign's 16 major academic units (illinois.edu/academics/academics.html), as well as connections to other major programs including the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities (www.iprh.illinois.edu), and University of Illinois Extension (extension.illinois.edu).
Faculty members in DURP are expected to produce a strong published record of scholarship and to maintain an active research agenda in their field. The Department places a high value on professional applications that lead to innovations in planning practice and dissemination of those innovations through scholarly publication and other means of communication. DURP faculty contribute courses to the Department's four degree programs: Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies and Planning (BAUSP), Master of Urban Planning (MUP), Master of Science in Sustainable Urban Management (MSSUM), and Ph.D. in Regional Planning. They also support masters and doctoral student research assistants.
Successful candidates are expected to perform the full range of designated faculty responsibilities including teaching, research, outreach/public service, and university service. A Ph.D. in planning or related fields is required. Candidates for assistant professor must possess or be near completion of a PhD or candidates whose PhD may be delayed but will complete all the PhD requirements within the first appointment year may be appointed at the rank of Instructor. After the PhD requirement is met, the appointment will be changed to Assistant Professor. The position is a full-time nine-month tenure-track faculty appointment that begins 16 August 2023. Salary is commensurate with experience.
All applications must be submitted online at illinois.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/1/home/requisition/1143?c=illinois.

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee

Position Number: 02120989

Introduction (Description of
School/College/Dept/Program)
Situated on the shores of the largest system of freshwater lakes on
earth, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee provides a world-class
and affordable education to 25,000 students from 90 countries. As
an R1 research and access university, we are committed to fostering
a welcoming and inclusive environment that values excellence in
research and teaching. We want to attract, retain, and grow a
diverse staff that honors unique experiences and perspectives, and
we take pride in the diversity of our student body, faculty and
staff, and programs.

The Psychology Department places a premium on excellence in
teaching and scholarly research. As a result, we are one of the
most dynamic and productive departments at UWM. The faculty are
recognized experts in their various disciplines as well as
accomplished teachers.

Job Summary
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) Department of
Psychology invites applications for a tenure-track position in our
APA-accredited Clinical Psychology Program. The appointment will be
made at the rank of Assistant Professor. UWM is a Carnegie Research
1 institution. The Clinical Psychology program is a member of the
Academy of Psychological Clinical Science. The department has rich
collaborative connections with the Milwaukee community and area
hospitals (e.g., Medical College of Wisconsin, Children's Hospital
of Wisconsin, Rogers Memorial Hospital, Milwaukee VA Medical
Center, LGBTQ+ Community organizations).

We are planning multiple tenure track faculty position hires in the
next few years spanning the areas of health equity research and
clinical neuropsychology. We will fill one position in either of
these areas this year.

For the position in health equity research (broadly defined) we
seek to hire a candidate whose research program is focused on
diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in mental health. This
could include, but is not limited to, investigation of factors
leading to, maintaining, and/or exacerbating inequities in mental
health or access to care; risk and resilience factors related to
systemic oppression, marginalization, and discrimination; social
drivers of mental health; research programs with a focus on
populations affected by inequities (e.g., racial and ethnic
minoritized individuals, LGBTQ+ individuals); culturally-affirming
intervention or assessment approaches (e.g., cultural adaptations
of existing approaches); dissemination and implementation science;
community-engaged approaches, population health approaches, global
mental health, and multiculturalism or multicultural education.
These examples are not exhaustive and we envision a wide range of
programs of research would match the position.

New hires would teach a newly developed graduate multicultural
psychology course required by our accrediting body. They would also
supervise doctoral students learning to conduct psychotherapy. At
the undergraduate level, we currently have only two undergraduate
courses which focus on multiculturalism, only one of which is
taught by a faculty member in our health psychology program. This
is a growing and necessary field of study in psychology,
particularly clinical psychology, and any undergraduate courses
taught by the new health equity faculty member would be
popular.

For the Clinical Neuropsychology position we seek to hire a
candidate who can demonstrate excellence in research, teaching and
mentorship. We welcome candidates with a wide range of research
expertise in human clinical neuropsychology research across the
developmental spectrum, although there are particularly strong
collaborative opportunities in the department in the areas of child
and adolescent neurodevelopment, longitudinal research, and
neuroimaging methods (see details below). We are seeking candidates
with teaching, research or clinical expertise in the areas of
cultural neuropsychology, assessment, neuropsychological diagnosis
and feedback, neuroimaging, and intervention techniques to
contribute to our SCN/Division 40-listed predoctoral specialized
training in Clinical Neuropsychology. Candidates must be
license-eligible, while board-certification eligibility in
neuropsychology is preferred (to bolster training environment) but
not required. Students and faculty are actively involved in
national neuropsychology organizations (e.g., APA/SCN, INS, NAN,
EMA, WIN, Society for Black Neuropsychology, Hispanic
Neuropsychology Society, ANST) and our predoctoral training model
is aligned with current Houston Guidelines (and we aim to align
with updated Minnesota 2022 Education and Training in Clinical
Neuropsychology guidelines). Collaborative relationships with
neuropsychology/neuroimaging departments in the wider Milwaukee
area are encouraged and opportunities to conduct assessments and
supervise training in our Psychology Clinic are available.

Minimum Qualifications

Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology or Comparative Discipline
Licensure or eligibility for licensure as a Psychologist in
Wisconsin and eligible for listing in the National Register of
Health Service Providers in Psychology

Introduction (Description of
School/College/Dept/Program)
Situated on the shores of the largest system of freshwater lakes on
earth, the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee provides a world-class and

The Anthropology Department consists of a vibrant community of
faculty, graduate students, undergraduates, and scholars. The
department offers BA, MS, and PhD degrees and Museum Studies and
Forensic Science certificates, and it provides students with
professional training in cultural resource management (CRM) through
the Archaeological Research Laboratory Center (ARLC). Many of our
programs reach beyond campus - from the Milwaukee Public Museum to
the Medical Examiner’s Office, the Wisconsin State Crime Lab, and
the Medical College of Wisconsin. As a field science, we offer
field schools that enable students to experience anthropological
research. In addition, our department is closely connected with the
ARLC; the ARLC houses a successful CRM program, serves as a
curation facility/repository for archaeological collections from
the Midwest, and cares for extensive bioarchaeological populations.

and government sectors as well as in business and academia.

as Introduction to Archaeology (ANTH 103), Archaeology of North
America (ANTH 308), Lithic Analysis (ANTH 502), Great Lakes
Archaeology (ANTH 565), and Archaeological Analysis and Report
Preparation (ANTH 566). In addition, the successful candidate will
be expected to teach a regional archaeological field school (ANTH
567) every other summer.The successful candidate will also serve as
faculty liaison between the department and the ARLC and serve on
the ARLC's Internal Advisory Committee. In 2021 the ARLC
coordinated over 600 extra-mural research projects with a combined

providing experiential learning opportunities and serves as an
employment pipeline for archaeology and Museum Studies students.

Full Professor: School Psychology Program Director
Counseling and School Psychology

Location: San Diego, CA
Open Date: Oct 05, 2022

Description
The SDSU School Psychology (SP) program is seeking a program
director and senior colleague with research activity and competence
in multicultural school psychology, consultation with diverse
communities, and work focused on youth from minoritized backgrounds
in school settings. A senior faculty member will bring skills
compatible with education specialist-level training and mentorship,
as well as leadership within the School Psychology program.

The School Psychology Program is a four-year integrated
graduate-professional program culminating in the Educational
Specialist (Ed.S.) degree in School Psychology and the California
Pupil Personnel Services Credential in School Psychology. The SP
program seeks a strongly qualiﬁed faculty member to advance our
nationally recognized 4-year graduate program and contribute to the
preparation of culturally diverse and responsive leaders in school
psychology. We are looking for a dynamic individual who can work
successfully in our systemically oriented collaborative faculty
core, as well as contribute to the long-term development of a
doctoral program. The program faculty are passionate about
preparing school psychologists to be systems change agents,
interventionists, and consultants in diverse schools. A commitment
to human diversity, educational equity, and social justice
permeates our training program and is supported through multiple
grant opportunities and partnerships to develop related
specializations. We adhere to an articulated philosophy that values
diversity and inclusion via a) recruitment and support of diverse
students, faculty, field supervisors, and other role models; b)
infusion of multicultural and anti-racist content in the training
curriculum and faculty members' research agendas; c) extensive
hands-on and experiential learning in culturally inclusive
educational environments; and d) shared community, mentorship, and
support for our students.

This position aligns with three University strategic goals: (a)
develop more doctoral programs, (b) increase the research
productivity and funding of the institution, and (c) move towards
classification as an HSI R1 institution. Thus, a new colleague will
bring high research/grant activity working with
youth/families/school communities around inclusive educational
practice and the capacity to serve as a research mentor to
assistant professors. Ideally, an applied research agenda with an
outcomes-based emphasis would position a new faculty member to
secure external funding from agencies such as the US Department of
Education or the US Department of Health.

Additionally, a new faculty member will offer practice-based
knowledge and a record of secured partnerships with diverse schools
and communities, aligning with the revised 2020 NASP training
standards, which significantly impact the graduate preparation and
credentialing of school psychologists. We seek senior faculty
expertise and leadership experience to align with newly focused
areas in these new standards (diversity, inclusion, cultural
competence, decolonizing teaching practices). A senior faculty
leader in our program could also work to develop long-term
strategic plans for hiring, faculty mentorship, promotion, and
tenure as well as cross-departmental grant/research
collaborations.

school psychology faculty member with leadership experience (i.e.,

community relationships. This new faculty member will bring
research skills compatible with external grant writing and research
agendas in some combination of the following areas: (a) social
justice agenda in the field of school psychology (race, ethnicity,
equity, antiracist practices), (b) evidence-based practices that
promote well-being among culturally and linguistically diverse
populations (c) consultation with diverse communities, and (d)
qualitative and quantitative research methodology.

at SDSU Imperial Valley, located in Calexico, California
(approximately 120 miles east of San Diego, CA).

This position requires the expertise to teach core Criminal Justice
undergraduate courses in criminology and law enforcement as well as
graduate courses in Homeland Security. If hired, the candidate is
expected to contribute to the expansion of the Homeland Security
graduate program at SDSU Imperial Valley. Professional activities
and publications in the applicant's area(s) of expertise are

SDSU Imperial Valley

Founded in 1959, SDSU Imperial Valley (SDSU-IV) offers 12
bachelor's and four master's degrees. With generally small classes,
SDSU-IV provides an intimate educational experience. The vast
majority of SDSU-IV students are from the Imperial County border
region (more commonly referred to as the Imperial Valley), and
remain after graduation. This offers a unique opportunity for
Criminal Justice/Homeland Security faculty, as the majority of
students become practitioners within the same region following
graduation.

Due to its proximity to the Mexican border, the campus serves a
student body composed largely of groups that are historically
under-represented in higher education. Given the regional focus,
responsive curriculum, and community engagement, SDSU-IV has become
a powerful engine of economic growth for the region. In Fall 2021,
SDSU-IV launched its first cohort of the Graduate Program in
Homeland Security. This next academic year, SDSU-IV is launching
new programs in Nursing and Public Health. The Calexico campus,
less than a two-hour drive from the SDSU main campus, is located on
an eight-acre city block in the heart of Calexico's civic center
along the Mexican border. The Imperial Valley region consists of
the Calexico, El Centro, and Brawley micropolitan areas along with
several other small towns within the Colorado Desert section of the
greater Sonoran Desert. Imperial County has an estimated population
of 180,000 residents. Visit our website, https://imperialvalley.sdsu.edu/.

The Division of Professional Studies

The SDSU Imperial Valley Division of Professional Studies offers
several programs stressing both academic and practical experiences
that prepare students for successful and productive careers in a
variety of professional fields including Criminal Justice, Homeland
Security, Nursing, Public Administration, Public Health, and Social
Work. Many of these programs are taught in an international or
global context and focus on emerging transborder issues. The
Division offers both undergraduate and graduate programs of study,
including four (4) undergraduate degrees and three (3) graduate
degrees.

San Diego State University

SDSU is the oldest institution of higher education in the San Diego
region, with a main campus in San Diego and locations in Southern
California's Imperial Valley as well as Tbilisi in the Republic of
Georgia. The highly diverse campus community has a student
population of approximately 36,000. SDSU is included in the
Carnegie Foundation's Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity
category. Established in 1897, SDSU offers bachelor degrees in 97

Apply By: Open until filled

Description

The University of Texas at Austin, College of Education, is
recruiting a cluster of three Tenure-Track assistant professors to
work with our world-class community of scholars to address research
and academic programs focused on reducing education and/or health
disparities among Latino/a children, families, and
communities.

Latinos have quickly become the largest racial/ethnic minority
subgroup in the U.S. The growth among Latino populations has led to
increased cultural pluralism and demographic shifts throughout the
country, including in Texas, where more than 40% of all state
residents and where 53% of K12 student population identify as
Latina/o. The growth of the Latina/o population also underscores
the many sources of variability within the community in terms of
language, nativity, place of origin, generational history, and
socio-historical context which contribute to health and wellbeing
of children, adults, and families.

The College of Education promotes the shared values of equity,
excellence, innovation, empowerment, community-focus, and endeavors
to bridge research and practice. We view inclusiveness and
excellence as interconnected in the work of our faculty. The
College of Education is particularly interested in and values
candidates who have experience working with diverse and underserved
populations, and address the interactions among our diverse
identities. Candidates should show a demonstrated commitment or
future potential to improving access and conditions in community,
school, and other settings for children, adults, families, schools,
and communities.

Successful candidates for the three tenure-track, assistant
professor positions within this cluster hire program will join
senior faculty colleagues who are identifying sources of systemic
inequities and leveraging culturally specific assets and strengths
to combat education and health disparities that impact Latina/o
communities in Texas, across the U.S., and in international
contexts throughout Latin America. The hires will be positioned in
one of three academic departments in the college, and will
contribute to the college's bold strategic vision to reimagine
education through interdisciplinary research and teaching, and deep
collaboration with communities.

Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of Youth and Community
Studies in Cultural Studies in the College of
Education

The University of Texas at Austin, Department
of Curriculum & Instruction, is seeking an Assistant
Professor whose research focuses on the interplay between the
education system and broader youth programs and service systems
(e.g., child welfare, juvenile justice, health, after-school
programs, community mentoring programs) with an emphasis on social
systems transformation to support positive youth development within
Latinx communities. Youth and Community Studies is
an undergraduate degree program with a core of courses related to
education and equity; these College of Education majors are
prepared for working with learners of all ages, often in community
settings. Students pursuing this degree can enter a track of
educational leadership and policy, early childhood, special
populations, coaching, or youth and social services. An
undergraduate degree option leading to certification for secondary
English language arts and social studies teachers (UT Urban
Teachers) also is included in this degree plan. Through this hire,
we are working to strengthen our existing undergraduate program in
Youth and Community Studies to create a more programmatic and
theoretical focus on how to leverage social systems to support
positive youth development, and to better align our program with
career opportunities in social service, non-profit, school, and
research settings (see teaching areas under “qualifications”
below).

This hire will contribute also to the Department of Curriculum
& Instruction's graduate programs. As described, the position
is interdisciplinary but anchored within the 
Cultural Studies in Education (CSE) Program, which is one of

nine graduate programs in the department. The CSE program is a
critical interdisciplinary program that studies social, cultural,
philosophical, and historical issues in education. The CSE program
addresses social and cultural theory, as includes existing faculty
strength in in qualitative methods including narrative,
theoretical, and ethnographic approaches for the study of
education. The graduate program considers Cultural Studies in
Education in a range of contexts, from the funds of knowledge of
family and community settings to the social, cultural, political,
economic, and contested struggles of public urban schooling. CSE
faculty and students recognize the power of alternative ways of
knowing, being and doing, and stress the significance diversity
plays in education. Students in this program explore the
fundamental importance of racial, ethnic, gender, and LGBTQIA2s+
diversity in and outside of formal education contexts.

As a leading college of education in Texas and beyond, we are
agents of change committed to transforming education and health
research, practice, and policy to ensure the thriving of children,
families, schools, and communities. In our efforts to align our
college to address the most pressing challenges in the fields of
education and health, we have launched a new strategic vision known
as 
Reimagine Education. In advancing this effort, we have
organized our academic and research aspirations around three
Signature Impact Areas: Advancing Equity and Eliminating
Disparities in Health and Education, Attending to Place and
Context, and Thriving through Transitions.

Applicants are expected to have a demonstrated track record of
research excellence, including a strong record of refereed
publications and a history of extramural funding and/or potential
to obtain extramural funding. Applicants should also have a strong
commitment to teaching and mentoring with a focus on enhancing
equity and inclusion in the field and in practice.

The University of Texas at Austin is the flagship state-university
of Texas. As a venue for research, Texas is one of the most diverse
states in the country with an increasingly culturally pluralistic
population, with students in the K-12 system and in general.
