Northwestern University invites applications for a full-time, tenured faculty position at the level of Associate or Full Professor for an anticipated fall 2023 start. The hire will become a core faculty member of Northwestern's new interschool humanities PhD Program entitled Rhetoric, Media, and Publics, the successor program to the PhD program in Rhetoric and Public Culture. The position will be jointly appointed in the School of Communication and the Medill School of Journalism. Applicants must hold a PhD in Communication Studies, Journalism, media studies, Rhetoric, or other related field within the humanities. Applicants should also have exemplary publication and teaching records.
Area of specialization is open, although we are particularly interested in candidates who will be able to teach the program's required doctoral seminar in the ""History of Media Technologies""; and whose research and teaching demonstrates a deep historical and theoretical knowledge of journalism, rhetoric, media, and communication regardless of period specialization. We are also interested in research profiles specializing in global, non-western, comparative, and non-English-language contexts, including research focusing on marginalized perspectives and decolonial approaches to media practices, rhetorics, technologies, forms, aesthetics, audiences, and publics.
The program in Rhetoric, Media, and Publics draws upon resources within three schools at Northwestern: the School of Communication; the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications; and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Consequently, we use interdisciplinary perspectives to investigate how different media are mobilized within modern historical contexts to constitute distinct publics with specific social relations as well as ethical-political orientations. Program inquiry focuses on a diverse array of media, from oral to print, from the visual to the sonic, from journalism to social, and from the performative to the digital. Our aim is to investigate how the formal and aesthetic particularities of different media technologies interact with the diverse aims that producers and their audiences bring to their use. By drawing upon rhetorical analysis, journalism studies, critical/cultural theory, media history, media aesthetics, and political theory, we train students to think rigorously about the relationships among individual experiences in everyday life and large-scale social, technological, and political transformations. We seek to understand how global inequalities are both perpetuated and challenged as audiences, publics, and communities are called into being through communication practices over time. We encourage our students not only to analyze but also to engage different publics in their scholarship, in order to deepen their critique of such inequalities.
Preferred Start Date: September 1, 2023
Salary: Competitive, depending on qualifications and experience.
Application procedure: Applications and supporting documents will be accepted only by online submission here.

also served by U.S. Route 25 from Southeastern Kentucky and
Kentucky Route 52 from the east and west. The Bluegrass, Mountain,
Daniel Boone, and Cumberland Parkways provide even greater
accessibility by automobile since the city is located near the
convergence of these arterial highways into the interstate
system.

EKU is dedicated to high-quality instruction, scholarship, and
service, and places emphasis on the three in that order. Through
its colleges and schools, the University seeks to offer quality

professional areas, and applied and technical disciplines. Through

engaging a diverse student body and faculty in a dynamic learning
environment. Our department provides cutting-edge research and is
shaping the next generation of critical thinkers, scientists, and
industry leaders.

Our main goal is to offer the highest possible level of education
in multiple fields of chemistry to our diverse student body. We
pursue our main goal by two main avenues: First, by providing high
quality programs for students who are interested in a career in
chemistry or one that requires a strong chemistry background. We
serve this group by offering a Bachelor of Science degree
accredited by the American Chemical Society. The Bachelor of
Science in Chemistry is mainly designed for students who plan to
enter into graduate programs in chemistry or other closely related
sciences. Second, we meet the needs of students who are interested
in a terminal degree in chemistry in order to find a job or to
enter into a professional school. We offer two non-accredited
majors to meet this goal, a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and
a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. The Bachelor of Science in
Chemistry or Biochemistry fulfills the needs for those students
interested in pursuing medical, dental, pharmacy, or optometry
school. Therefore, a major in Chemistry or Biochemistry, prepares
students for multiple career paths: graduate work in chemistry or
biochemistry, careers in the biomedical or biotechnology fields,
teaching in secondary schools, or entry into professional
schools.

About the Opportunity

About Northeastern:

Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and
the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our
world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students,
faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the
confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco and Oakland; Seattle; Silicon
Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of
Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university
system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:

The College of Science at Northeastern University (Boston Campus)
invites applications for positions at all ranks (Assistant
Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor), beginning in
academic year 2023-2024 in the field of Experimental Biological
Physics, broadly defined. The College of Science comprises six
departments: Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Marine and
Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology.

This opportunity is part of a broader Biological Systems and
Solutions thematic search. If interested in other opportunities
under the Biological Systems and Solutions theme, click here:
[LINK].

In this era, it has become exceedingly apparent that discoveries
made in the physical sciences are critical for expanding our
fundamental understanding of life and transforming medicine. For
example, basic observations made in the study of RNA modifications
led to the development of a new class of vaccines that can be
rapidly designed and administered. The candidate is expected to
further existing knowledge or develop new, quantitative,
technologies that address important questions in biophysics at the
level of molecules, cells and tissues, or the sum of the parts
(systems biology). Topics include, but are not limited to,
unraveling physiological processes involved in disease, using
single-molecule tools to investigate the structure, function and
dynamics of molecules, investigating the building blocks of life at
a single-cell level, and understanding biological regulation using
synthetic biology approaches.

The successful candidate will ideally complement existing research
strengths and will have the opportunity to collaborate with, and
help develop, cross-disciplinary teams across the University. The
primary appointment will be in Physics, with possible joint
appointments in other departments including Bioengineering,
Biology, or Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Cross-disciplinary
research programs and appointments are strongly encouraged within
the College, and across the University.

The Department of Physics (https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/)
includes 40 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 9 full-time teaching
faculty; two research faculty; and one professor of the practice.
Physics enrolls over 100 undergraduate physics majors and over 200
physics majors combined with other majors; 16 MS students; and over
100 PhD students. The College of Science and Physics Department are
in a vibrant expansion phase.

Northeastern is home to the Coastal
Sustainability Institute, the Global Resilience
Institute, the Barnett Institute for
Chemical and Biological Analysis, the Center for Drug Discovery, the Institute for Chemical Imaging of
Living Systems, the Network
Science Institute, the Northeastern
University Center for Renewable Energy Technology, an NSF Frontier Center in Theoretical
Biological Physics, and the Center for
Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems, providing a rich
multidisciplinary intellectual environment.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork along with individual initiative. Hires will be mentored
for success, with mentoring teams and group guidance. In addition,
a strong and effective faculty development strategy is part of the
Northeastern institutional mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty
Development office works in conjunction with the Office of Research
Development (ORD), the Office of Institutional Diversity and
Inclusion (OIDI), the Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning
Through Research (CATLR), and University Decision Support (UDS) to
provide programs and trainings to further develop and support a
thriving faculty.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations. Opportunities to collaborate extend
beyond the University.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each

The primary responsibility will be directing the University Chorus (see http://chorus.ucdavis.edu/), consisting of UC Davis students and community members. The chorus performs at least three times per year, at the UC Davis Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, sometimes in conjunction with the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra or other departmental ensembles.
The choral director’s duties will include recruiting, auditioning, preparing the ensemble for performances, as well as the various administrative tasks associated with directing a large choir. Additional competencies are also welcome, such as proficiency in foreign languages, keyboard skills etc.
Additional teaching duties will include one or more of the following: MUS 142 (“University Chamber Singers”), MUS 145 (“Early Music Ensemble”), and/or academic courses based on department need and the candidate’s areas of expertise. It will also be possible for the candidate to form new vocal ensembles based on the expertise of the candidate.
Professor of Teaching positions at the University of California are designed to support our campuses’ academic mission by emphasizing excellence in undergraduate education. Traditional tenure track positions primarily emphasize professional contribution (e.g., research or creative works) while professors of teaching are expected to primarily support the teaching mission. As members of the Academic Senate, professors of teaching are also expected to serve on departmental and campus committees and to continue developing a national and international profile of professional accomplishments.
The new chorus director also has access to two endowments (approximately $25.000 annually) associated with the chorus. The chorus endowments have traditionally helped to offset rehearsal and concert expenses such as hiring soloists, accompanists etc, and have helped to offset students’ lesson fees and travel expenses for off-site concerts.
Numbering approximately 35,000 students, the community at UC Davis represents the expansive diversity of the state of California. We are seeking applicants who are excellent teachers, committed to collaboration, and whose vision of choral repertoire and performance practice is broadly inclusive. We are especially interested in candidates whose work engages with topics relevant to the community, including social justice and anti-racism. Applicants should have experience in teaching and working with individuals from diverse backgrounds, and contribute to the University's mission, vision, and core values.
The ideal candidate will have a master’s or doctoral degree in conducting, or in a related field, or have equivalent experience.
Applications should include a cover letter that summarizes the candidate’s relevant experience and outlines how the candidate might fulfill the requirements summarized above. Please also include a Curriculum Vitae, a list of three references, a Statement of Contributions to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and provide no more than five links to conducting videos of both rehearsals and concerts that best represent the candidate’s work.
Applications can be submitted electronically through the online application form found at: https://recruit.ucdavis.edu/JPF05279
Applications should be received by December 1, 2022, to ensure full consideration.
The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application, and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in a safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment, discrimination, exploitation, or intimidation. With this commitment, UC Davis conducts a reference check on all first choice candidates for Academic Senate Assistant Professor or Lecturer with Potential for Security of Employment, Steps 4, 5, or 6, or Acting Professor of Law positions. The reference check involves contacting the administration of the applicant’s previous institution(s) to ask whether there have been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the University’s Faculty Code of Conduct. To implement this process, UC Davis requires all applicants for any open search for assistant professor to complete, sign, and upload the form entitled “Authorization to Release Information” into RECRUIT as part of their application. If an applicant does not include the signed authorization with the application materials, the application will be considered incomplete, and as with any incomplete application, will not receive further consideration. Although all applicants for faculty recruitments must complete the entire application, only finalists considered for Academic Senate Assistant Professor or Lecturer with Potential for Security of Employment, Steps 4, 5, or 6, or Acting Professor of Law positions will be subject to reference checks.

The position seeks to identify highly qualified candidates with expertise at the intersection of data science and biomedical engineering, and will be centered in the College of Engineering's School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering.
 
The College invites applications for multiple open rank, 9-month tenure-track faculty positions at the Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor level. These positions will start on August 1, 2023, and are an academic year appointment (9 months) with an opportunity to supplement salary during the summer. Candidates considered for the associate or full professor rank must have qualifications and academic credentials that are commensurate with the promotion and tenure guidelines at the University of Georgia. These guidelines can be found at the College of Engineering Criteria for Promotion and Tenure.
 
The hiring is part of a campus-wide Presidential Interdisciplinary Faculty Hiring Initiative in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence that aims to recruit 50 faculty members who will educate students and advance research in data science and AI. Rather than being housed exclusively in a single department, however, the majority of UGA’s newly recruited faculty will focus on the fusion of data science and AI in cross-cutting areas such as biomanufacturing, infectious diseases, integrative precision agriculture, ethics, cybersecurity, resilient communities, and the environment.

The focus of this hiring initiative will be in the field of Precision Medicine for One Health - which is an interdisciplinary approach to integrate research for human, animal, and environmental health. The positions will be part of a cluster spanning the School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering, College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Public Health, and College of Pharmacy. Areas of research and scholarship may include, but are not limited to, using data science approaches to advance understanding of human health, diagnostics, medical devices, and therapeutics.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensuring that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity in our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of the University and the College of Engineering's Strategic Plan, and this hiring initiative will make use of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan for the College of Engineering identifies priority areas for our investments and through the 2022-2023 academic year we are working to finalize a Diversity Strategic Plan. The college offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support professional development. Several programs exist to enhance the inclusiveness of our College, including a student-led Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.
 
The College of Engineering already has significant expertise in basic and translational research in biochemical engineering, cellular and pharmaceutical biomanufacturing, biomaterials and tissue engineering, and biomedical optics. We are interested in candidates that will strengthen or complement these areas in keeping with the theme of data science and artificial intelligence for precision health, in particular the use of mathematical modeling and systems biology tools to develop quantitative models of complex physiological systems to understand mechanisms of disease progression and/or pharmacodynamics.
 
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a rapidly-growing College of Engineering that combines interdisciplinary research and scholarship with excellent instruction and service. The UGA College of Engineering currently enrolls over 4,000 engineering majors and has over 125 full-time faculty across 15 degree programs. The College of Engineering is comprised for four interdisciplinary schools: The School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical Engineering, The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering, and The School of Computing -- an innovative joint-program shared with Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, which launched this year.

Significant investments in infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of laboratory facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms and instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have space in two major capital projects on campus to create interdisciplinary research facilities. Our main instructional facility, Driftmier Engineering Center, has also undergone complete renovation to create flexible classrooms that enable a range of teaching modalities and the incorporation of interdisciplinary instructional labs. The common instructional facilities also foster diversity by allowing faculty, staff, and students to interact and collaborate in a single facility.

A Ph.D. in any engineering discipline relevant to the field of precision health/medicine.

The position seeks to identify highly qualified candidates with expertise at the intersection of data science and biomedical engineering, and will be centered in the School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering.

The College invites applications for one open rank, 9-month tenured or tenure-track faculty position at the Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor level. This position will start on August 1, 2023, and is an academic year appointment (9 months) with an opportunity to supplement salary during the summer.

Through this cluster hire, UGA seeks to build on its existing core strengths in modeling infectious disease. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: epidemic forecasting, biosurveillance, applications of artificial intelligence to infectious disease research, and nonparametric, agent-based, and multi-scale modeling of disease transmission.
 
The hiring is part of a campus-wide Presidential Interdisciplinary Faculty Hiring Initiative in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, which aims to recruit 50 faculty members who will educate students and advance research in data science and AI. Rather than being housed exclusively in a single department, however, the majority of UGA’s newly recruited faculty will focus on the fusion of data science and AI in cross-cutting areas such as biomanufacturing, infectious diseases, integrative precision agriculture, ethics, cybersecurity, resilient communities, and the environment.

This position is specifically part of the infectious disease cluster hire, which includes additional positions in other units across campus, including Statistics, Ecology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Public Health, and Arts and Sciences. To facilitate interaction among these researchers, each faculty member will have membership in the Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) and/or the Institute of Bioinformatics (IOB). Collectively, these new faculty members will help position UGA to contribute to anticipated national networks of centers for molecular epidemiology, predictive intelligence for infectious diseases, and infectious disease forecasting, modeling, and analytics.

The successful applicant will be expected to:

Establish an outstanding research program recognized both nationally and internationally.
Foster partnerships within and outside the University of Georgia as well as industry.
Exhibit a strong commitment to teaching excellence at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
Compete successfully for extramural funding to support research and companion graduate and postdoctoral training programs.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensuring that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity in our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of the University and the College of Engineering’s Strategic Plan, and this hiring initiative will make use of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan for the College of Engineering identifies priority areas for our investments and through the 2022-2023 academic year we are working to finalize a Diversity Strategic Plan. The college offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support professional development. Several programs exist to enhance the inclusiveness of our College, including a student-led Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.
 
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a rapidly growing engineering college that combines interdisciplinary research and scholarship with excellent instruction and service. The UGA College of Engineering currently enrolls over 4,000 engineering majors and has over 125 full-time faculty across 15 degree programs. The College of Engineering is comprised for four interdisciplinary schools: The School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical Engineering, The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering, and The School of Computing — an innovative joint-program shared with Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, which launched this year.

Significant investments in infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of laboratory facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms and instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have space in two major capital projects on campus to create interdisciplinary research facilities. Our main instructional facility, Driftmier Engineering Center, has also undergone complete renovation to create flexible classrooms that enable a range of teaching modalities and the incorporation of interdisciplinary instructional labs. The common instructional facilities also foster diversity by allowing faculty, staff, and students to interact and collaborate in a single facility.

Psychology

Location: San Diego, CA
Open Date: Sep 29, 2022

Description
The Department of Psychology at San Diego State University invites
applications for a faculty position at the Assistant Professor rank
in Clinical Psychological Science with a focus on underserved
communities. We seek an individual with an established
translational research program focused on the phenomenology,
etiology, prevention, and/or evidence-based treatment of major
mental health conditions, broadly defined, among underserved
communities with a demonstrated record of success in research,
teaching, and/or service with underserved populations. The
department currently has strong health equity and
prevention-to-intervention health science research programs in
mental health, chronic illness, and developmental and
neurodegenerative disorders, and this position will complement
existing department strengths in translational health
science.

The successful candidate will establish or continue a productive
program of research in clinical psychological science with a focus
on underserved populations. We consider underserved populations to
consist of individuals (1) whose psychological distress or
disorders are systemically misidentified or underidentified, (2)
that experience disproportionate barriers to accessing mental
health resources or services, and/or (3) that have typically not
been considered in the development of models of psychopathology or
resilience, or the development/implementation of
prevention/intervention programs. Some examples of underserved
populations include members of racial/ethnic, sexual, gender,
religious, or cultural minorities. Other examples include migrant,
refugee, undocumented, or unhoused individuals. The successful
candidate's program of research may occur at any point along the
translational spectrum of mental health research (i.e., from
documenting associations and mechanisms that contribute to mental
health disorders in underserved populations through the
dissemination and implementation of interventions for underserved
populations).

Example research foci may include (but are not limited to)

Examination of cognitive, social, emotional, and/or
physiological processes that contribute to mental health disorders
among members of underserved populations
Identification of the social and/or systemic determinants of
mental health disparities among underserved populations
Examination of the impact of intersectionality (i.e.,
membership in more than one underserved population) on mental
health and/or mental health disparities
Adaptation and development of evidence-based
prevention/intervention programs for mental health disorders that
specifically target the needs of underserved populations
Identifying resilience resources and/or processes within
underserved populations that could be leveraged for strength-based
prevention/intervention programs
Examination of the effectiveness of dissemination and
implementation strategies that extend the reach of evidence-based
services to underserved populations



Qualifications
Candidates must hold a doctorate in Psychology or allied discipline
(or be ABD with the expectation of holding a doctorate before the
position start date), with preference for candidates with doctoral
training in clinical psychology. Candidates should have a strong
record of research productivity and evidence of current, or

successful candidate will be able to leverage resources within the
SDSU campus, including a dedicated 3T MRI scanner, high performance
computational centers, strong mentoring and pilot research support
for junior faculty, as well as collaborative research resources,
such as the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute,
at University of California, San Diego through the Joint Doctoral
Program in Clinical Psychology. The SDSU Psychology Department also

behavioral and translational science of addiction. An understanding
of the populations at greatest risk of addiction and behaviors
underlying that risk is needed to develop, test and implement
efficacious new interventions for prevention and treatment and to
impact public health policy. The ability to apply methods, tools
and findings across contexts and disciplines is also essential. To
that end, we seek a scholar capable of leading and collaborating on
translational research. We have particular interest in a scholar
with expertise in areas that are existing strengths for Bouve and
Northeastern, including, but not limited to technology-based
assessment or intervention, artificial intelligence/big data,
behavioral neuroscience, behavioral genetics, the genetics of
addiction, animal models of addiction, counseling interventions
in-person and/or via telehealth, health care policy; and social
justice/reduction of stigma. There is strong potential for
collaborations on translational research with investigators from
the Center for Drug Discovery, the College of Science, the College
of Social Sciences and the Humanities, the College of Arts, Media
and Design, the School of Law, and other units at
Northeastern.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork. Hires will be mentored for success, with mentoring teams
and group guidance. In addition, a strong and effective faculty
development strategy is part of the Northeastern institutional
mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development office works in
conjunction with the Office of Research Development (ORD), the
Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI), the Center for
Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and
University Decision Support (UDS) to provide programs and trainings
to further develop and support a thriving faculty.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each
person is trained and mentored to promote their success.

RESPONSIBILITIES

The successful candidate will be located in Boston and have a
tenure home in one of the 8 departments in the Bouve College and

The anticipated start date is August 16, 2023.
  Qualifications
 
We are interested in candidates whose practice, teaching, and/or research connect to one or more of the following areas of design: Visual Anthropology, Design for Impact and Sustainability, Design by/with the Global South, Gender and Design, Sexuality and Design, Queering Design, Design for Diverse Abilities, Equity and Design, and Design for Peace.
 
As this position is primarily based in a Graphic Design program, familiarity with current and historical approaches to visual communication and experience design will be required. However, we seek applicants who are pushing beyond traditional approaches to re-center those excluded by the discipline, or to invent new methodologies and approaches. These could include indigenous design knowledges, applied experimentation in visual communication, social interaction design, liberatory approaches to the development and the dissemination of knowledge, social scientific approaches in urban or rural contexts, futuring/defuturing, collaboration across disciplines and with community partners, and design for dismantling and reimagining inequities faced by historically marginalized communities.
 
Candidates are required to have a terminal graduate degree in design, applied arts, social sciences, informatics, or a related field. Candidates whose terminal degree is outside design need to demonstrate academic experience in creative disciplines, a growing record of scholarly and/or professional research, design work, publications, and/or exhibitions, demonstrate teaching effectiveness, and have a strong capacity to engage with contemporary design as a social, aesthetic, collaborative, and professional discipline.
 
We encourage individuals with MDES, MFA, DDES, Ph.D. in design or a related field or a BFA, BSAS/BAAS, or BLA with an advanced degree in another area to apply.
 
Responsibilities
 
Candidates will contribute to the BFA and MFA programs’ diverse and proactive approaches to leading and reshaping the design field through research, pedagogy, and service, the broader equity goals set by the College of Fine and Applied Arts to create and sustain just, equitable, and sustainable communities, the undergraduate (BFA) program in Graphic Design, the graduate (MFA) program in Design Responsible Innovation, and future graduate programs, and the School of Art & Design and the University of Illinois through research, service, and public engagement.
 
Teaching responsibilities consist of two courses in the fall and two in the spring (2/2). This may include core undergraduate courses, foundation studios, and graduate courses. Course assignments are based on departmental needs. The candidate will contribute to existing digital design and interactive media curricula and implement new courses at entry and advanced levels. Salary is commensurate with experience. Additional responsibilities include service through shared governance to the department, school, college, campus, university, discipline, and/or the local community.
 
Context
 
Building upon its longstanding reputation for excellence, the Graphic Design (undergraduate) and Design for Responsible Innovation (graduate) programs in the School of Art & Design are responsive to the contemporary design landscape. The current faculty engages in a range of research interests, methods, and modes of practice that collectively expand and redefine traditional notions of design in practice and academia. The BFA program in Graphic Design negotiates challenges at the intersection of traditional craft and rapidly evolving communication technologies, preparing students to effect positive change in contemporary social and cultural systems. The MFA program in Design for Responsible Innovation investigates forms of intentional action to reify and maintain positive, equitable, and meaningful futures desired by sustainable networks of human and non-human actors.
 
Student and faculty work is supported by staffed labs for traditional and contemporary media, including spaces for digital imaging and printing, audio-visual production, rapid two- and three-dimensional prototyping, and darkroom photography. Facilities for bookbinding, letterpress, printmaking, and fashion design are also available. The School offers undergraduate and/or graduate degrees and concentrations in Art Education, Art History, Fashion, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Design for Responsible Innovation, New Media, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, and Studio Art.

Applicants can find relevant information about the Department of Plant Pathology at www.plantpath.wisc.edu, and any questions regarding the position may be directed to the position search committee chair, Dr. Andrew Bent, afbent@wisc.edu. Applications are encouraged from citizens of any nation. Option to start prior to or after August 21, 2023.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison is one of the world's premier research universities and attracts a diverse body of outstanding faculty, staff and graduate students from around the world. State-of-the art research and teaching facilities are provided both in Madison and at multiple agricultural research stations throughout the state. The 963-acre campus is located on the shores of Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin. Madison is a picturesque city with a strong economy and a vibrant cultural environment, and is consistently ranked among the top small U.S. cities in which to live.
In addition to extensive corn, soybean and forage crop production, Wisconsin is one of the top three states in the U.S. for production of potatoes, snap beans, cranberries, green peas, carrots and sweet corn. Plant parasitic nematodes damage all crops grown in Wisconsin and also figure prominently in statutes regulating the movement of plants for international trade. Staffing of this position is needed both to combat the current and future threats that nematodes pose to the state's agricultural industry and to retain core research and teaching expertise in nematology, which is one of the four core plant pathogen groups that plant pathology departments cover. Nematode pest problems in agriculture are significant and their management is uncertain in the face of climate change and reduced chemical control options. Novel research on the biology, ecology and/or epidemiology of nematode pests may include, for example, focus on high impact areas such as predictive modeling to forecast surges in pest populations, establishing species-specific damage thresholds for a number of important crops, identification of nematode virulence mechanisms and best targets to achieve nematode control, and using remote sensing and geostatistical analysis to map nematode populations in the field.

*EQUIVALENCY

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to
select outstanding faculty members from the largest possible pool
of qualified applicants, recognizes the fact that candidates may
attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent
qualifications are encouraged to complete and submit the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) with their application
for review by the Districtwide Equivalency Committee.

Example:

Minimum Qualifications state: “Master's degree in
agriculture”.

Candidate's transcripts state: “Master's degree in agricultural
science”.

Since the degree on the candidate's transcripts in the example do

qualifications section, this candidate MUST complete the Supplemental Questionnaire for
Equivalency (Download PDF reader) in order to be
considered. When completing the form, be sure to explain in detail
how your qualifications are equivalent to the required minimum
qualifications. Do not assume that you do not need to submit a
Supplemental Questionnaire for Equivalency because your degree is
similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

Supplemental Information
SELECTION PROCESS

A screening committee will review and screen all applications and
associated materials. The candidates deemed most qualified for the
position will be invited to an interview. When completing the
application and the supplemental questions, it is important to
outline in detail your education, training (classes, seminars,
workshops), and experience. You will be evaluated based upon the
information provided.

Position Description


The Baskin School of Engineering (engineering.ucsc.edu) at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) is conducting a cluster
hire in the area of experiential learning for engineering, and
invites applications for one or both of the available Assistant,
Associate, or Full Teaching Professor positions. Baskin Engineering
is in the exciting early stages of its experiential learning
program, which encompasses a First Year Design program and a
Capstone Senior Design sequence. An associated Experiential
Learning Facility will support these programs, envisioned as an
inclusion-centered maker and creative space facility. We seek
candidates who are excited by creating and researching novel
interdisciplinary experiential learning experiences for the diverse
students at UC Santa Cruz.

One selected candidate will direct and teach primarily in the
Capstone Senior Design program, where teams of senior level
students design and construct substantial projects during a
two-quarter project sequence. Many projects are performed in
collaboration with stakeholders from outside UCSC. The selected
candidate will also participate in the direction and potentially
the teaching of the First Year Design program. The selected
candidate is expected to work in collaboration with participating
departments in the Baskin School of Engineering to develop an
updated educational vision for an interdisciplinary and deeply
inclusive and equitable capstone senior design program with strong
connections to local nonprofit organizations and industrial
partners.

One selected candidate will direct and teach primarily in the First
Year Design program, where teams of lower division engineering and
non-engineering students create a modest tangible or software
artifact over a quarter. Students learn skills related to their
project, and engage in a design-build-evaluate-revise process. The
selected candidate is also expected to have strong involvement in
setting the programmatic vision for the Experiential Learning
Facility, which encompasses student clubs, multi-year thematic
areas, and year-long projects. The selected candidate is expected,
in collaboration with students, to develop and maintain a cluster
of first year design project courses.

Candidates with strength in at least one of the following areas are
strongly encouraged to apply:
● A track record of design or engineering project-based
collaboration with commercial, non-profit, or educational
groups;
● A track record of leading first year design or engineering design
courses;
● Strong background in one or more of the areas of focus of Baskin
Engineering including software engineering, systems engineering,
computer systems design, web and mobile application design,
engineering design, product design, service design, electrical
systems design, mechatronics, cyber-physical systems, robotics,
bioinformatics, bioengineering, networking, and computer
games;
● Educational research concerning capstone design programs, first
year design, experiential learning, and entrepreneurial
thinking;
● Experience creating, leading, or developing programming for an
engineering makerspace facility;
● Experience directing multiple simultaneous engineering
teams;

Selected candidates are expected to develop an educational research
program, supported by external grants, driven by personal
intellectual inquiry with likely focus areas including the senior
design program, first year design program, other experiential
learning programs, engineering education, or broadening
participation in engineering.

The working title of this position is Assistant, Associate, or Full
Teaching Professor, while the payroll titles are Lecturer with
Potential Security of Employment, Lecturer with Security of
Employment, and Senior Lecturer with Security of Employment. These
titles are used differently at the University of California than at
some other institutions. Important facts to note are: this position
has all the rights and responsibilities of membership in the
Academic Senate, “Security of Employment” is directly analogous to
tenure, this title earns sabbatical credit in the and has summer
flexibility. Candidates hired into these positions will have
Principal Investigator status for the purpose of grant applications
and administration. Faculty members in this position, as with all
faculty, will be regularly reviewed for further advancement and
salary increases. The Security of Employment series is evaluated on
achievements in the areas of teaching, professional achievement and
activity, and University and public service set by the University
of California system.

Assistant Professor

North Carolina Central University
 Closing Date: at 11:55 PM

Primary Purpose of Position:
The Department of Criminal Justice is seeking applications to fill
one nine-month tenure-track position (611204) at the Assistant
Professor level starting the Fall 2023 academic year. The selected
candidate will be expected to teach a full course load (a minimum
of 12 credit hours per semester), to include course instructions
that achieve student learning outcomes, annual scholarly outputs,
and engage in significant service with the Department and
University Community.

Criminal Justice is the largest undergraduate program at NCCU, and
it is projected to grow at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
This position is essential to the department's efforts to support
all undergraduate programs (face-to-face, online and site based
campus) and the graduate program, a priority of both the University
and department. We are exploring implementing Hyflex options for
course delivery at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Hyflex
will allow students to learn where they are as this modality allow
students to attend class synchronously in person or online and
asynchronously by watching recorded synchronous lectures on their
own time. The Hyflex modality will allow the degrees in criminal
justice to be more accessible especially at the graduate level,
which will generate the need for additional resources.

The vacancy of this position (611204) will place a significant
burden on the Department and faculty. This position is critical to
the mission of the Department of Criminal Justice and the
University's efforts to promote student success (i.e., retention
and graduation) at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Moreover,
lacking a qualified person in this tenure-track Assistant Professor
position will limit the productivity of the unit in regards to
producing peer-reviewed scholarship and securing externally-funded
projects. These two things are related as grant funding agencies
base their funding decisions in part on the evidence of competence
by the prospective researcher/investigative team or unit (i.e., the
Department). Lacking qualified tenured/tenure-track faculty
jeopardizes our recertification, and limits our ability to obtain
additional certifications (e.g., ACJS Certification of our graduate
program). The vacancy created by this departure, which is a
significant component of our curriculum, a professional area of
interest among students, and is a major area of research and
potential external funding. Furthermore, the lost faculty member
was an important anchor to our instruction in the area of research
methodology, which is a significant component of our undergraduate
and graduate curricula. Efforts to hire new faculty will focus on
the aforementioned gaps, extramural funding and related
instructional/research areas.

Minimum Education/Experience:
A doctorate in Criminal Justice or a closely related discipline
from an accredited institution is required. Applicants must have at
least 18 Doctoral-level hours in Criminal Justice or related
discipline. A Juris Doctorate does not qualify for the position.
ABD candidates will be considered. Degree must be conferred by May
2023.

Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
Responsibilities will include teaching undergraduate and graduate
level courses through face-to-face and online instruction, engage
in curriculum development and assessment at the graduate and
undergraduate levels, and advise/mentor students for graduate-level
thesis and projects. As a tenure-track faculty member, faculty must
engage in peer-reviewed scholarship to meet the requirements for
promotion and tenure, and to meet the goals and objectives of the
University, College, and the Department. This includes
participation in externally-funded research activities (i.e.,
grants), particularly in conjunction with the Department’s two
institutes: The Institute for Homeland Security and Workforce
Development and the Juvenile Justice Institute. The person must
also engage in significant service within the Department and
University Community, and their respective academic/professional
disciplines. The ability to work independently as well as

minors in both Theatre and
Dance. We provide a student-centered educational experience within
a liberal arts context and
a collaborative community that values and respects all voices. In

reshape departmental policy and practice. Hallmarks of the
department include: outstanding
teaching; small class sizes; hands-on and experiential learning;
close interaction with faculty and
staff; an artist-scholar approach to curriculum; and multiple
opportunities for undergraduates

artists, design independent
creative projects, and attend workshops, trainings, and
festivals.

About the Fellowship: The successful candidate will spend one or
two years as a Smith PTT
Fellow at Bucknell, bringing new perspectives and contemporary
knowledge and participating in
campus life. The Fellow will receive mentoring, a reduced teaching
load, resources for scholarship and professional development, and
other support that will help them a) better understand the nature
of a career as a teacher-scholar-artist at a predominantly
undergraduate institution; b) develop and strengthen their
pedagogical skills and experience; and c) establish and enhance
their research trajectory. During the fellowship period, the

Job responsibilities include teaching 4 courses/year at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and conducting thesis supervision.
This appointment in philosophy is made in the context of a new interdisciplinary initiative at the University of California, Berkeley whose goal is Understanding (Non)Citizenships. Although applicants to this position will be appointed in philosophy, we seek candidates whose research speaks to and advances the goals of the “Understanding (Non)Citizenship” initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, which aims to hire an interdisciplinary cluster of faculty on this topic over two years. The cluster tackles three overarching themes: issues of justice, fairness and equality as related to (non)citizenship; the determinants and content of (non)citizenship; and the consequences of (non)citizenship. The cluster considers citizenship broadly, as a legal, social and cultural status that combines civil, political and social rights with a sense of identity, encompassing those who lack formal citizenship but also those who experience “second-class” citizenship through differential rights and treatment. Fully understanding (non)citizenship requires an interdisciplinary approach: claims for citizenship and equality are invariably normative, while the consequences and drivers of (non)citizenship must be studied empirically to understand change and effects. For this reason, this innovative cluster of faculty hiring will bring together diverse units in the social sciences, humanities and professional schools across UC-Berkeley. Faculty hired through the Understanding (Non)Citizenship cluster will hold positions in Philosophy, Political Science, Public Policy, Sociology and Law. In 2022-23, the University seeks applicants for an Assistant Professor position in Philosophy and a tenured (Associate or Full Professor) position in Political Science.

Additional Information:
The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) was created by
the Texas Legislature in 2013 as the first major public university
of the 21st century in Texas. This transformative initiative
provided the opportunity to expand educational opportunities in the
Rio Grande Valley, including a new School of Medicine, and made it
possible for residents of the region to benefit from the Permanent
University Fund - a public endowment contributing support to the
University of Texas System and other institutions.

UTRGV has campuses and off-campus research and teaching sites
throughout the Rio Grande Valley including in Boca Chica Beach,
Brownsville (formerly The University of Texas at Brownsville
campus), Edinburg (formerly The University of Texas-Pan American
campus), Harlingen, McAllen, Port Isabel, Rio Grande City, and
South Padre Island. UTRGV, a comprehensive academic institution,
enrolled its first class in the fall of 2015, and the School of
Medicine welcomed its first class in the summer of 2016.

UTRGV is a distributed institution. As such and as assigned, the
position may require presence at multiple locations throughout the
Rio Grande Valley. Work is performed primarily in a general office
environment. This position is security sensitive and thereby
subject to the provisions of the Texas Education Code §51.215. The
