POSITION DESCRIPTION
Computing provides a powerful new lens for viewing the world. The
questions of where we choose to turn this lens, who gets to look
through this lens, and what new steps society takes based on the
information provided by this lens are some of the most important
questions that we could ask ourselves. UC Santa Barbara understands
that this is too important to the future of our society to be left
to any population or discipline -- and we are building a department
ready to address these questions head-on in authentic partnership
with thought leaders across our campus and the world. UC Santa
Barbara is a premier top-7 public research university. The
Department of Computer Science is part of the highly ranked College
of Engineering, which includes among its faculty three Nobel
laureates and 16 members of the National Academy of
Engineering.

In this search, we seek tenure-track or tenured faculty members in
all areas of Computer Science. AI/Machine Learning, Quantum
Computing, Security and Privacy, and Database Systems are priority
areas for the department. However, outstanding candidates in all
areas will be considered. We seek faculty eager to build on our
existing research collaborations in the Center for Responsible
Machine Learning, the Center for Black Studies Research, the Center
for Information Technology in Society, the Institute for Energy
Efficiency, and well beyond, and to help us establish new
partnerships and research programs bringing computation and
computational tools to problems of societal importance. We seek
motivated and passionate researchers eager to work with a community
of their peers to address issues of societal importance through
surprising and creative applications of computing. The department
is especially interested in candidates who can contribute to the
inclusive excellence of the academic community through research,
teaching, and service as appropriate to the position. Successful
candidates for faculty positions will demonstrate evidence of a
commitment to equity and inclusion in their application materials,
including the Diversity Statement. A primary appointment will be in
the Department of Computer Science, but affiliate or joint
appointments in any partner departments across engineering, social
sciences, humanities, and/or physical sciences are strongly
encouraged. The Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara
understands that computing intersects society in many complex ways
but that by striving to be a place where every student, faculty,
and staff can grow and thrive, we will position ourselves to be the
best to take on these challenges together!

Applicants will be considered by an interdisciplinary group of
faculty, and all applicants must have a demonstrated record of
excellence in, or show exceptional promise for, high-quality
research, teaching, and service to the community. Applicants with a
demonstrated record of interest in, and commitment to, the
mentorship of students from underrepresented and underserved
populations will be given particular attention. Candidates will be
offered the opportunity to satisfy a portion of their undergraduate
teaching responsibilities through active mentoring and leadership
in programs that provide research and professional development
opportunities for our diverse student body (e.g., through the Los
Ingenieros, UCSB Women in Computer Science, the Early Research
Scholars Program, or the CBSR Student Engagement and Enrichment in
Data Science Program).

Candidates will be considered for the endowed Stansbury Chair in
Computer Science. Stansbury Chair appointments focus on attracting
a leading-edge junior scientist and educator working in
cutting-edge areas that help the University prepare our students
and position the University for the future. The goal of the
Stansbury Chair is to identify, recruit, and nurture a junior
scholar that will emerge as one of the next generations of leaders
and educators.

disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a

by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring

equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

About the Opportunity

About Northeastern:

Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and
the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our
world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students,
faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the
confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London;
Portland, Maine; San Francisco and Oakland; Seattle; Silicon
Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of
Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university
system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible,
student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused
research.

Northeastern's comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate
programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to
degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among
these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees
designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and
careers.

About the Opportunity:

The College of Science at Northeastern University (Boston Campus)
invites applications for positions at all ranks (Assistant
Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor), beginning in
academic year 2023-2024 in the field of Experimental Biological
Physics, broadly defined. The College of Science comprises six
departments: Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Marine and
Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology.

This opportunity is part of a broader Biological Systems and
Solutions thematic search. If interested in other opportunities
under the Biological Systems and Solutions theme, click here:
[LINK].

In this era, it has become exceedingly apparent that discoveries
made in the physical sciences are critical for expanding our
fundamental understanding of life and transforming medicine. For
example, basic observations made in the study of RNA modifications
led to the development of a new class of vaccines that can be
rapidly designed and administered. The candidate is expected to
further existing knowledge or develop new, quantitative,
technologies that address important questions in biophysics at the
level of molecules, cells and tissues, or the sum of the parts
(systems biology). Topics include, but are not limited to,
unraveling physiological processes involved in disease, using
single-molecule tools to investigate the structure, function and
dynamics of molecules, investigating the building blocks of life at
a single-cell level, and understanding biological regulation using
synthetic biology approaches.

The successful candidate will ideally complement existing research
strengths and will have the opportunity to collaborate with, and
help develop, cross-disciplinary teams across the University. The
primary appointment will be in Physics, with possible joint
appointments in other departments including Bioengineering,
Biology, or Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Cross-disciplinary
research programs and appointments are strongly encouraged within
the College, and across the University.

The Department of Physics (https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/)
includes 40 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 9 full-time teaching
faculty; two research faculty; and one professor of the practice.
Physics enrolls over 100 undergraduate physics majors and over 200
physics majors combined with other majors; 16 MS students; and over
100 PhD students. The College of Science and Physics Department are
in a vibrant expansion phase.

Northeastern is home to the Coastal
Sustainability Institute, the Global Resilience
Institute, the Barnett Institute for
Chemical and Biological Analysis, the Center for Drug Discovery, the Institute for Chemical Imaging of
Living Systems, the Network
Science Institute, the Northeastern
University Center for Renewable Energy Technology, an NSF Frontier Center in Theoretical
Biological Physics, and the Center for
Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems, providing a rich
multidisciplinary intellectual environment.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork along with individual initiative. Hires will be mentored
for success, with mentoring teams and group guidance. In addition,
a strong and effective faculty development strategy is part of the
Northeastern institutional mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty
Development office works in conjunction with the Office of Research
Development (ORD), the Office of Institutional Diversity and
Inclusion (OIDI), the Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning
Through Research (CATLR), and University Decision Support (UDS) to
provide programs and trainings to further develop and support a
thriving faculty.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations. Opportunities to collaborate extend
beyond the University.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each
person is trained and mentored to promote their success. See our
website for more information about the College and its Leadership
Team.

Responsibilities:

The potential hires are expected to develop vigorous research
programs cross cutting the fields of physics, chemistry, biology,
and bioengineering. Faculty members at Northeastern are expected to
develop independent research programs that attract external
funding; teach courses at the graduate and undergraduate level;
supervise students and postdocs in their area of research; and
participate in service to the department, university, and
discipline. Qualified candidates must have excellence in, or a
demonstrated commitment to, working with diverse student
populations and/or in a culturally diverse work and educational
environment.

Qualifications:

Applicants must have a PhD in physics or a closely related field by
the appointment start date. We encourage applicants from a wide
range of backgrounds, including academia and industry.

All applicants should have a strong record of scholarly
accomplishment that demonstrates the ability to build a strong
research program. Candidates seeking appointment at the Associate
or Full Professor level should have substantial research
productivity and an established history of grant support and
academic service. Research excellence is the top-most priority.
Depending on the research profile and expertise, a joint or
affiliate appointment in another department(s) within the
University is possible.

Additional Information:

Interested candidates should apply here with a curriculum vita that
includes a list of publications, statements addressing the prompts
below, and names and contact information for at least three
professional references from whom letters of reference can be
solicited as needed. Applications will be reviewed beginning on

respond to such situations, not the identities of the people
involved, so please only disclose what you are comfortable with.
Your statement should demonstrate an understanding of the barriers
facing individuals from groups marginalized in your field and be in
alignment with 
Northeastern's mission to reflect the diversity of the
societies in which it maintains campuses and to meet the
educational needs and interests of its diverse population. Some

RECRUITMENT DESCRIPTION
 
The Department of English at UCLA invites applications for a tenure-track position in Latinx literary studies at the rank of Assistant Professor with duties beginning July 1, 2023. We are interested in a scholar whose work examines the context and histories of Latinidad through a critical, cultural, and literary lens. We particularly value scholarship situated in a hemispheric context that is located in or conversant with Central American Studies. We value scholars as well devoted to Afro-Latinidad and Blackness, to Queer and Trans Latinidades, or/and to Indigenous and Decolonial Studies. We also welcome the opportunity to broaden our engagement with performance, film, and the visual arts. Each of these critical and aesthetic fields offers vibrant areas of study relevant to the Los Angeles region and to the interests of our students. The Department is particularly invested in finding candidates committed to mentoring undergraduate and graduate Latinx students and other students of color. This position highlights the centrality of the Humanities in collaboration with the urban communities that surround UCLA as well as neighboring communities across Los Angeles and nationally, part of an effort to connect to Indigenous Latinx communities in the region and to assist with the development of an Urban Studies Minor at UCLA. Above all else, we seek applicants whose research, teaching, and service address the multidimensionality of Latina/o/x experiences in critical, original, and compelling ways.
 
 
 
The Department of English seeks applicants who examine Latinidad through a broad range of perspectives and approaches. We are eager to build on our department’s existing strengths in Chicanx and Latinx literatures and cultures from the 19th to 21st centuries. We offer numerous courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, several of which are cross listed with the César Chávez Chicana/Chicano and Central American Studies Department. Our faculty have extensive experience collaborating with the Chicano Studies Research Center, especially working with the CSRC Library, which holds one of the most important research collections on Chicana/o/x experiences. The English Department also houses the Latinx Literary Reading Group that brings together faculty and students across several departments at UCLA to discuss current work in the field and to form a collaborative community that supports group members with their own writing.
 
 
 
Complete applications should be received by November 16, 2022 at https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/JPF07891, and must include:
 
1) A cover letter that discusses the candidate’s research in the field of Latinx studies, teaching experience and interests, community engagement, and any other relevant experience.
 
2) A statement that indicates the applicant’s investments and contributions to equity, diversity, and inclusion, including research or related work that challenges racism and/or other forms of subordination such as classism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.
 
3) A current CV.
 
4) Three (3) letters of reference.
 
5) A writing sample of 20-25 pages that represents the candidate’s research interests and methodological strengths in the field of Latinx studies.
 
 
 
A Ph.D. in literary studies or a related field is required by date of hire. Review of applications will begin immediately after November 16, 2022. The committee may request additional materials after an initial examination of the applications.
 
 
 
UCLA aims to achieve federal designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution by 2025. In preparation for this designation, the Office of the Chancellor and the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost have sponsored this search in order to recruit exceptional scholars whose teaching, scholarship and/or mentoring has strong ties to Latinx experiences in the United States. This search is conducted in partnership between the Chicano Studies Research Center and the Department of English. Faculty hired through this search are expected to develop an active relationship with the Chicano Studies Research Center and to encourage the success of all students, especially Latinx and first-generation scholars.
 
 
 
UCLA has programs to assist in partner employment, childcare, schooling, and other family concerns. For additional information, visit the UCLA Academic Personnel Office website or the UC Office of the President’s website.
 
 
 
The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application, and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in a safe and secure environment, free of violence, harassment, bullying and other demeaning behavior, discrimination, exploitation, or intimidation. With this commitment as well as a commitment to addressing all forms of academic misconduct, UCLA conducts targeted employment reference checks for finalists to whom department or other hiring units would like to extend formal offers of appointment into Academic Senate faculty positions. The targeted employment reference checks involve contacting the finalists’ current and prior places of employment to ask whether there have been substantiated findings of misconduct that would violate the University’s Faculty Code of Conduct. To implement this process, UCLA requires all applicants for Academic Senate faculty positions to complete, sign, and upload the form entitled “Authorization to Release Information” into RECRUIT as part of their application. If the applicant does not include the signed authorization to release information with the application materials, the application will be considered incomplete. As with an incomplete application, the application will not receive further consideration, only finalists (i.e., those to whom the department or other hiring unit would like to extend a formal offer) considered for Academic Senate faculty positions will be subject to targeted employment reference checks.
 
 
 
As a condition of employment, you will be required to comply with the University of California SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccination Program Policy. All Covered Individuals under the policy must provide proof of Full Vaccination or, if applicable, submit a request for Exception (based on Medical Exemption, Disability, and/or Religious Objection) or Deferral (based on pregnancy) no later than the applicable deadline.

(Capitalized terms in this paragraph are defined in the policy.) Federal, state, or local public health directives may impose additional requirements.

Olin College is advancing Engineering for Everyone through Impact-centered Education. Located outside Boston, Olin College was founded in 1997 with a mission to develop students as exemplary engineers, to drive positive change in engineering education, and to do good in the world. In this short amount of time, Olin College has become recognized as a leader in engineering education: Olin’s graduates are recognized for their creativity, initiative, and ability to make a difference, and Olin collaborates with other institutions and individuals around the world to change engineering education. Now we are starting a new chapter. Today, we have a new president, Dr. Gilda Barabino, and a brand-new Strategic Plan that centers on Impact-Centered Education and Engineering for Everyone. We’re focused on achieving equity both within and through engineering. Would you like to join us in shaping Olin’s next chapter? 
engineering 
Impact-centered Education decenters both the faculty member and the student, instead aligning both around purpose, meaning, and community through making impact—together. Olin’s mission is transforming engineering education toward a world in which engineering serves everyone. Olin defines engineering broadly, from understanding people and their needs, to designing solutions, to creating new technologies and services to benefit people and society. Our approach to engineering education erases boundaries between disciplines, encourages students to take control of their learning, and emphasizes human-centered design and entrepreneurship. There are no departments at Olin. Faculty not only teach in their disciplines, but also work together to co-design transdisciplinary, experimental, experiential, learning opportunities. We delight in involving students in our research, consulting, and other forms of professional work.  
is for everyone. 
We believe engineering education must be accessible and welcoming for people from all backgrounds, and that engineering should serve not only individuals but also society and the planet. Today engineering education fails to address the systemic challenges that exclude so many promising young people from the engineering profession. Today engineers too often ask “How can we design it?” before asking “Should we design it?” These failures perpetuate deep inequities, and addressing them will require questioning how we teach and how we do engineering, as well as who is included in these conversations. This won’t be easy. It will require collaboration, humility, and diverse ways of thinking; it also will require a willingness to take risks and think big.  And that’s why we’re excited to embrace this challenge.  
Join us. 
Are you passionate about equity and access? Do you want to join us in reframing who can be engineers and what counts as engineering? Do you want to mentor students to better integrate engineering and other fields as they study and tackle complex technical systems and societal challenges? Come join our team. We are particularly interested in candidates (all ranks) with computing backgrounds who demonstrate a commitment to engaging students in real-world and transdisciplinary contexts and whose work is aligned with Olin’s strategic priorities. “Computing” includes traditional computing fields like computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, and data science but also may include the use of computational techniques in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, or humanities. Olin is committed to becoming an increasingly inclusive and diverse learning community that supports equitable learning opportunities for everyone, and we strongly encourage women and individuals from historically underrepresented communities to apply.  
We plan to hold a number of virtual events in October at which you can connect with Olin faculty and get to know more about our community. If you would be interested in attending any of these events, we invite you to provide us with your email address in this form. We look forward to connecting with you and learning about you!

Our application system will invite you to submit: 
1. An Olin-specific cover letter. 
In this Olin-specific cover letter, we invite you to share with us why you are excited to join our community, what impact-centered education means to you, and how our new Strategic Plan resonates with you. We also invite you to comment on the work you have done in the area of equity and access, and what work you might want to do in this domain in the future.

The Department of Art, Art History, and Design at Michigan State
University seeks a full-time, academic year tenure-system or
tenured academic appointment at the rank of Assistant Professor or
Associate Professor of Graphic Design with a focus on Critical Race
Studies to commence August 16, 2023.

We seek a designer who centers their practice in visual
communication and/or graphic design, while demonstrating the
capacity to critically engage issues of race and representation
through creative activity. Of particular interest are designers
with a record of work that engages with historical and systemic
experiences of the racially marked body, that explores the
structural inequalities of the present, or that engages at the
intersection of race and gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity or
religious identity. Applicants should engage contemporary design
pedagogies grounded in equity, agency, and critical thinking. Area
of design practice is open, but candidates should contribute to the
further development of established practices of visual
communication and/or extend or combine such practices to extend the
field in new directions.Responsibilities include engagement in an
active program of teaching (normally, two courses per semester
including participation in the College of Arts & Letters'
general education program in the Interdisciplinary Arts and
Humanities), research, and service, with outreach components.

This position will contribute to a thriving Graphic Design BFA
degree program with students preparing for roles in the profession,
as well as the College of Arts and Letters' interdisciplinary
Experience Architecture degree. MSU's Graphic Design program is
oriented by long-term faculty research/creative interests in social
justice, environmental sustainability, and critical approaches to
design and design technologies as well as deep commitments to the
Graphic Design profession. The Graphic Design program is part of
the Department of Art, Art History, and Design (AAHD), which also
supports undergraduate programs in Apparel and Textile Design, Art
Education, Art History and Visual Culture, and Studio Art and an
MFA in Studio Art with an interdisciplinary focus. Its faculty are
committed to integrating the history and practice of art and design
into the MSU community through teaching, research, and public
engagement. We further the mission of the arts to deepen
understanding of the human condition. Design is embedded in
curricular programs and research centers across MSU's
R1/research-intensive university campus, presenting many
opportunities for collaboration among faculty with various
interests and forms of expertise.

This position builds upon AAHD's artist/designer residency in
Critical Race Studies (2017-22), a visiting faculty program
designed to enliven, deepen, and connect campus and community
discussions of race through creative practice. Across an
academic-year, residents built cross-disciplinary, cross-campus,
and/or community-based curricular and creative projects that
consistently demonstrated the extraordinary potential for creative
practice to create new forms of knowledge about crucial issues of
everyday life. The Critical Race Studies residency program is one
of many initiatives within the College of Arts and Letters to
reinvigorate studies of race and intersectionality, including major
investments in the Department of African American and African
Studies and continued support of programs in Asian-American
Studies, American Indian and Indigenous Studies, Chicano/Latino
Studies, and Gender and Women's Studies. MSU has a longstanding
commitment to international studies, as well, including centers and
programs focused on African Studies, Asian Studies, and Muslim
Studies. Applicants should articulate the ways that they could
contribute to the broad institutional goals represented by these
initiatives, including by working across disciplinary divides to
collaborate with other faculty in AAHD, MSU's College of Arts and
Letters or other colleges, as well as a wide array of
students.

About the Opportunity:

The College of Science at Northeastern University invites
applications for positions at all ranks (Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor, or Professor), beginning in academic year
2023-2024 in the field of Sustainable Blue Economies broadly
defined. Primary appointments will be in Marine and Environmental
Sciences with joint appointments in other departments including the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Department
of Psychology, and/or the D'Amore-McKim School of Business.
Appointments will have the opportunity to collaborate in
cross-disciplinary teams across the University and will complement
existing strengths.

This opportunity is part of a broader Food, Water, Energy Nexus
thematic search. If interested in other opportunities under the
Food, Water, Energy Nexus theme, click here: 
Open Rank Faculty Search: Cross Disciplinary Search- Food, Energy,
Water Nexus

The College comprises six departments: Biology, Chemistry and
Chemical Biology, Marine and Environmental Sciences, Mathematics,
Physics, and Psychology. Cross-disciplinary research programs and
appointments are strongly encouraged within the College, and across
the University.

Seafood presently accounts for 17% of global protein intake and
with projected population growth, this reliance will exceed 70%.
Demand will be increasingly difficult to meet given that 60% of the
world's largest natural fisheries are already heavily or
over-exploited. Aquaculture accounts for almost half of global
seafood production, but the market is dominated by China with the
US efforts contributing an anemic 2% to the global market.
Sustainable Blue Economies represent a transformative
opportunity for the US market, but macroscale (climate change) and
local impacts, including social-political barriers that emerge
because of coastal pollution from aquaculture operations, will
continue to stymie progress. Overcoming this viscosity will require
multidisciplinary collaborations involving natural, social and
cognitive scientists, engineers, political scientists and decision
makers, and private sector incubators and stakeholders. We seek the
broad expertise necessary to enhance the security and
sustainability of coastal food production through aquaculture,
including but not limited to: fisheries science; sensitivity of
marine species to climate change; ecological and evolutionary
genomics; social, economic and cognitive barriers to the adoption
of aquaculture; and innovative financing and engineering solutions
to sustainable aquaculture productivity.

The Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES, https://cos.northeastern.edu/marine-environmental-sciences/)
includes 21 tenured/tenure-track faculty and 7 Research or Teaching
Professors, 43% of whom are women and/or from underrepresented
groups. MES embraces interdisciplinary teaching and research and
counts 10 faculty among it ranks that have joint appointments in
other colleges or departments. The Department currently supports
approximately 500 undergraduate majors in Environmental and
Sustainability Science, Environmental Studies, Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, and Marine Biology. In addition, MES enrolls
more than 150 students in its Masters Programs in Environmental
Science and Policy and Marine Biology and 35 students in its PhD
program in Marine and Environmental Sciences. In partnership with
the Coastal Sustainability Institute and Marine Science Center, the
MES community continues to lead the way in creating new knowledge
and innovative solutions that promote cleaner, safer, smarter and
more equitable coastal communities.

Northeastern is home to the Coastal
Sustainability Institute, the Global Resilience
Institute, the Barnett Institute for
Chemical and Biological Analysis, the Center for Drug Discovery, the Institute for Chemical Imaging of
Living Systems, the Network
Science Institute, the Northeastern
University Center for Renewable Energy Technology, an NSF Frontier Center in Theoretical
Biological Physics, and the Center for
Interdisciplinary Research on Complex Systems, providing a rich
multidisciplinary intellectual environment.

Our tenure and promotion process values collaborative research and
teamwork. Hires will be mentored for success, with mentoring teams
and group guidance. In addition, a strong and effective faculty
development strategy is part of the Northeastern institutional
mission. The ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development office works in
conjunction with the Office of Research Development (ORD), the
Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion (OIDI), the Center
for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and
University Decision Support (UDS) to provide programs and trainings
to further develop and support a thriving faculty.

Northeastern University is a global university system. Positions
will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be available at any
of our 14 campus locations. Opportunities to collaborate extend
beyond the University.

At Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where
each person is valued for their contribution and is treated fairly.
We oppose all forms of racism. We support a culture that does not
tolerate any form of discrimination and where each person may
belong. We strive to have a diverse membership, one where each

About the Opportunity

Northeastern University is searching for multiple tenured and
tenure-track faculty candidates at all ranks (Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor, or Professor) as part of a coordinated
university-wide search in the broad research areas at the nexus of
food, water, and energy. The Food-Energy-Water Nexus has a complex
and intertwined influence on our everyday lives, with
socio-economic, medical, and environmental impacts across the
globe. Critical interdependencies are being laid bare, for example
as climate change-induced drought is decimating crops and shutting
down power plants for lack of cooling water, while at the same time
increasing electricity demand for air conditioning. Sustaining
these essential resources through the 21st century and avoiding
mass species extinction will require a deep understanding of the
interconnections between socio-technical and ecological systems as
well as innovations in reducing risks and improving resilience and
sustainability. This complex nexus with its different contributors
will need to adapt and evolve over time in response to changes
within our broad global ecosystem. Therefore, with research areas
from supply chain resilience to the blue economy, multi- and
interdisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers, architects,
designers, humanists, ecologists, social scientists, policy-makers,
ethicists, and economists working at the food-energy-water nexus
will tackle grand challenges to improve our world.

Faculty will have a primary tenure home department in one of the
following colleges: College of Engineering, College of Science,
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Arts, Media
and Design, or the D'Amore-McKim School of Business. A secondary
joint appointment in a different college or a different department
is encouraged depending on the candidate's discipline and
interests. Appointments will have the opportunity to collaborate in
cross-disciplinary teams across the University and will complement
existing strengths. Northeastern University is a global university
system. Positions will primarily be on the Boston campus but may be
available at any of our 14 campus locations.

Responsibilities

Faculty members at Northeastern are expected to develop independent
research programs that attract external funding; teach courses at
the graduate and undergraduate level; supervise students and
postdocs in their area of research; and participate in service to
the department, university, and discipline. Candidates interested
in conducting high-impact research programs and committed to
teaching excellence in the broad areas above are encouraged to
apply.

Qualifications

A Ph.D. or terminal degree in a discipline relevant to one of the
representative areas of interest and the department of primary
appointment by the appointment start date is required. We encourage
applicants from a wide range of backgrounds, including academia and
industry.

resilient when confronted with enormous challenges such as (1)
climate change, (2) social and environmental injustice, (3)
biodiversity loss, and (4) global disruptions including war,
pandemics, or disasters. Global progress in these areas requires
transformative scholarship and leadership in many areas, including
but not limited to governance and policy, infrastructure system
design and construction (with emphasis on innovative infrastructure
designs, decarbonization, biological conservation and climate
justice), regulatory design that encourages social, political and
economic transitions (such as efficient and equitable uses of
resources, emphasis on renewables), and fair distribution of
burdens without undo impact on other species, the environment and
communities with environmental justice concerns. Additional areas
of emphasis include connectivity of global supply chains, the
future of work, development of inclusive workforces, life cycle
impacts of urban architecture including operational and embodied
carbon emissions, mitigation and adaptation of coastal ecosystems
and settlements, the interaction of genomes with their
environments, and the design of resilient and equitable communities
and cities. Candidates who employ research methods spanning
multiple disciplines and who intend to build interdisciplinary
research programs that center on justice and ecological integrity
are strongly encouraged to apply.

Faculty will have a primary tenure home department in one of the
following colleges: College of Engineering, College of Social
Sciences and Humanities, College of Arts, Media and Design, the

To that end, an ability to bridge quantitative and qualitative forms of research is indispensable, as is the capacity to work across scales from the building to the urban and larger environment. Applicants whose research engages in the creation of a more just and sustainable environment are especially of interest.
The position is available beginning fall 2023. We especially encourage applications from historically underrepresented voices, and we welcome interest from those whose work and lived experiences will expand our conversations, perspectives, and practices.

Position Announcement

The Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of
Oregon invites applications for a tenure-track professor (open
rank) in Urban Ecological Justice. It is well-documented that
disadvantaged communities have significantly less access to clean
water, healthy food, moderated microclimates, sanitation, secure
shelter, flood control, waste collection, air quality, parks, urban
wildlife, and natural beauty. Climate change portends ever more
dangerous and unhealthy environments in the form of more frequent
flooding, food scarcity, housing displacement, heat waves, and
other threats particularly faced by low-income households. Despite
evidence of effective environmental solutions to social injustice,
a distinct gap remains in the research addressing implementation of
such solutions.

Well-designed landscape architecture solutions can foster improved
socioeconomic, physical health, mental health, and well-being by
providing public spaces derived from the desires, traditions, and
strengths of engaged community members. Thus, we welcome potential
faculty members to join with our faculty and students in addressing
inequities as we shape our world.

Teaching duties may include landscape design studios (graduate and
undergraduate), foundations, ecology, technical issues in landscape
design (e.g., site analysis, media, planting design), productive
landscapes (agriculture, forestry, food-forests) as well as courses
related to community engagement, spatial justice, food sovereignty,
and design for a sustainable world.

The 9-month academic year salary comes with a generous benefits
package. Typically, tenure-track faculty members teach five 11-week
courses or studios per year (slightly less than the semester
equivalent of four courses per academic year). New faculty members
have a reduced teaching load of four 11-week courses per year for
two years. Teaching, research, and service are 40%, 40%, and 20% of
the workload, respectively. Faculty often serve as advisors for
students, but most advising is provided by advising staff
members.
Department or Program Summary

The BLA, MLA, and PhD in Landscape Architecture programs at the
University of Oregon each provide rigorous, accredited curricula
combining theory, research, design skills, and extensive real-world
studio instruction so that students become effective and creative
leaders in the profession. A Bachelor of Environmental Design
degree is also in the planning phase. Landscape Architecture
programs are located on University of Oregon's main campus in
Eugene.

The College of Design is a leader and exemplar on the University of
Oregon campus for our ongoing activities addressing diversity,
equity and inclusion. The College is an international leader in
promoting the Spatial Justice Initiative, which brings visiting
scholars to the School of Architecture & Environment to teach
and research on spatial justice issues. Students and faculty in the
department of landscape architecture have crafted a DEI Toolkit,
which proactively guides our actions in making the department an
inclusive place to work and study. The College offers a supportive
and collaborative teaching and research environment and actively
encourages applications from candidates from diverse
backgrounds.
Minimum Requirements

Required qualifications include a master's degree in landscape
architecture, evidence of research productivity, and evidence of
teaching accomplishment.
Preferred Qualifications

Preferred qualifications are: PhD in Landscape Architecture or
related field; an accredited degree (BLA or MLA) in landscape
architecture; registration as a landscape architect.

The Ventura County Community College District, in its desire to

attain expertise in a discipline through a variety of means.
Certain combinations of education, experience and other
accomplishments in the field may be judged by the District as equal
to the stated minimum qualifications for this position.

Candidates whose transcripts do not list the title of their degree
exactly as listed above, but feel they possess such equivalent

similar to a degree stated in the minimum qualifications. Degree
titles that are not an exact match will not be considered outside
of the equivalency process.


The equivalency review is an independent process for district wide
disciplines that is separate from the recruitment process to fill a
vacancy. A subcommittee of discipline experts that is coordinated
by an Academic Senate President will review the equivalency
materials and make a recommendation as to whether or not the
applicant demonstrated they have qualifications that are equivalent
to those shown in the minimum qualifications section of the job
posting. For disciplines that are unique to a specific campus the
equivalency may be done by the hiring committee along with an
Academic Senate President. Please be aware that the hiring
committee may not be able to wait for the results from the
equivalency review due to various time constraints and may need to
move forward with the recruitment process.

For further details regarding equivalency and the criteria by which
equivalency may be granted, please review VCCCD Board Policy 7211 and VCCCD Administrative Policy 7211.

Rockefeller Cancer Institute team and help us fight the battle against cancer and cancer health disparities. 
Open Faculty Positions 
The Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, College of Medicine, at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) invites talented researchers to join an exemplary team of investigators to advance novel research in cancer control and population sciences.  Applicants who qualify for Assistant or Associate Professor and with a terminal degree (e.g. MD, PhD, ScD) are invited to apply for 12-month tenure-track positions.  Applicants for an Associate Professor position should have a strong record of peer-reviewed research publications and a strong record of extramural funding.  Applicants for an Assistant Professor position should have a record of peer-reviewed publications and extramural funding or demonstrate evidence of the ability to obtain extramural funding if s/he is not currently funded. Successful applicants will hold an academic appointment in the hiring department. 
Faculty positions are supported by generous funds from the state as part of a significant investment to secure National Cancer Institute cancer center designation.  The Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute is the nation’s premier cancer center in Arkansas, with the largest cancer research portfolio in the state.  The Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute treats over 2,500 patients annually and trains students and health professionals. Our faculty and staff are committed to advancing research that leads to novel prevention and treatment strategies that are delivered in the community and clinic settings.  
The Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences Program is one of four premier research programs that provides ample opportunities for transdisciplinary, translational, and high impact research.  The Program seeks to define and understand the etiology of cancer health disparities in rural, low resource, medically underserved, racialized, and minoritized communities across Arkansas.  High priority research areas of interest include cancer prevention (tobacco, nutrition security, obesity), cancer screening in rural areas, and cancer survivorship. Our mobile health screening vans provide opportunities to develop unique community engaged research programs in breast, colorectal, and lung cancer screening to reach rural populations. Because social and structural determinants are major underlying risk factors for cancer in Arkansas, the Program leverages support from the Translational Research Institute (NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award), the P50 Center for Research Health and Social Justice (NIMHD), multiple Centers for Biomedical Research (COBRE), the Arkansas State Colorectal Cancer Screening Program, the UAMS Institute for Digital Health and Innovation, the UAMS Psychiatric Research Institute, the National Center for Toxicology Research (FDA), and through multiple colleges and departments to advance cancer prevention and control research unique to our catchment area. Our multi-million-dollar NIH-funded center and infrastructure grants provide numerous opportunities for pilot funding, training, and collaborative partnerships.
The Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute is located in the capital city of Little Rock.  The central location, quality of life, job market, cost of living, unique neighborhoods, outdoor life, and cultural attractions, including the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum, make it one of America’s top places to live and retire.   We offer a collaborative work environment and productive partnerships across UAMS Colleges as well as state health agencies, health care providers, business and law schools, and other academic institutions.
Candidates should email a current CV, a letter describing their background and professional interests, and a list of at least three possible references to:

If the applicant does not include the signed authorization to release information with the application materials, the application will be considered incomplete.

Diversity Statement PromptDiversity is a defining
feature of California's past, present, and future. Increasing the
diversity of our educators to better reflect the population of
California is just one aspect of the College of Education's
dedication to just, equitable and inclusive education. Diversity
refers to the variety of personal experiences, values, and
worldviews that arise from differences of culture and circumstance.
Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion,
language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic
status, geographic region, and more.

All College of Education students leave with a perspective that
recognizes, honors, and respects the knowledge and strengths all
learners bring from their communities and identities. This
perspective is known as Just Equitable and Inclusive Education
(JEIE) and is evident in all our programs. College of Education
students use this perspective to make community-based assets an

Given a new era of technology and data collection is revolutionizing how we understand human behavior – be it with machine learning and artificial intelligence, causal inference with big data, or analytics and corpus methods – we purposefully avoid narrow restrictions on applicants’ interest areas or competencies. We also welcome applications from scholars whose formal training might not include psychology so long as their work demonstrates strong ties to psychological theory and are capable of publishing in disciplinary journals in psychology and cognitive science.
We also anticipate that a new hire will be closely involved in the development of the Cognition, Behavior, and Information group’s education initiatives. We are in the initial stages of building a novel program that will equip undergraduate and graduate students with the statistical and advanced data science tools they will need to study human behavior. This program aims to be maximally inclusive, serving students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and who possess a range of technical skills. We encourage applicants to share their vision for the development of such a program and the topics they would cover, as well as the role they would take in helping to shape it.

Associate Professor in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Nutrition
& Health Equity

The Department of Nutritional Sciences at the Pennsylvania
State University seeks applications for one Tenure-eligible
position in the area of Maternal Child Health (MCH) Nutrition &
Health Equity. MCH is broadly defined and includes not only
pregnancy, lactation, and infants, but also families, school-age
children, adolescents and emerging adults. Focus areas in this
space would prioritize equity in nutrition prevention and
promotion, including dissemination and implementation activities,
for underserved and marginalized MCH populations. The hire will be
co-funded by Penn State's Department of Nutritional Sciences
(http://nutrition.hhd.psu.edu) and the Penn State
Social Sciences Research Institute (SSRI) (https://ssri.psu.edu/)
and is part of a cluster hire of four faculty members in different
units across Penn State who will add to an existing campus cluster.
The goal of this cluster is to foster collaborations among social
and behavioral scientists, and others, working from the person- to
the population levels on understanding and reducing disparities.
Colleagues with strong interdisciplinary and translational
orientations are particularly desired. The tenure home will be in
the Department of Nutritional Sciences. The position comes with a
competitive start-up package and salary based on 36-weeks of
service annually, which can be supplemented with additional salary
up to a total of 48 weeks from external competitive grants and
contracts and/or from endowment funds.

MCH populations are particularly vulnerable to social determinants
of health and adverse nutrition-related health outcomes, yet the
proportion of research effort that is allocated to health
prevention for these populations as compared to chronic disease
management is small. Modifiable factors in the ecology,
particularly those factors related to social and structural
determinants of health, have population-level impacts on the
ability to maintain a healthful diet, particularly for MCH
populations who are at greater risk for food and nutrition
insecurity. Inequities in these determinants limit the potential
for optimal health and development. This position will complement
the research of existing faculty within the Department, SSRI, and
across the University, which includes research related to
prevention of cardiovascular disease; ingestive behavior;
mechanisms of obesity; studies of diet, physical activity and
cancer prevention; maternal child health including pregnancy and
lactation; research on genetic models of inflammation;
epidemiology, and global health nutrition.

Applicants will be expected to maintain a successful research
program and to teach in the Department's undergraduate and graduate
programs. Teaching and service expectations will be appropriate to
Penn State's mission as a Land Grant university. The successful
applicant's research may span the translational research spectrum
from preclinical to population-based work. We are seeking a highly
motivated individual with:

Minimum Qualifications

An earned doctoral degree in nutrition, public health,
psychology, social work, public policy, or closely related field
(PhD, MD and/or equivalent) is required
Evidence of original research published in peer-reviewed
journals and evidence of past and potential for extramural
funding
Proficiency in teaching and mentoring students
Research that is synergistic with core areas of the strategic
plans of the Department of Nutritional Sciences, SSRI, the College
of Health and Human Development, and Penn State overall, of which
Enhancing Health is one of five thematic priorities (http://strategicplan.psu.edu/thematic-priorities/
)



Desired Qualifications

Credentials as an RDN



The Department seeks applicants whose professional preparedness,
experience, and accomplishments are informed by experiences working
with and within groups historically underrepresented in higher
education in the United States. Priority will be given to
applicants who demonstrate, through prior actions and achievements,
intentional and actioned commitment to diversity, equity, and
inclusion. Examples of such contributions are research or creative
activity focused on empowering underserved populations; teaching,
mentorship, and service that increases equitable access; and
inclusion in fields where historically excluded populations are
underrepresented.

Professor specializing in Latinx and Latin American history with a
focus on Central America, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, and/or

century. Candidates should demonstrate a commitment to excellence
in research, teaching, and service. This position is one of 14 new
ladder-rank faculty positions in the Latinx Cluster Hire Initiative
(LCHI) at UC San Diego. The LCHI aims to increase faculty
diversity, innovative research, and culturally relevant curriculum
and mentorship through increased engagement and collaboration

Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) to a full-status HSI that meets
the curricular and cultural needs of Latinx, URM, and
first-generation students. This includes faculty engagement with
scholars across disciplines to address issues of race and racism,
access and equity, and social and political debates pertinent to
Chicanx, Latinx, and Latin American Studies, while also working
within their home departments and professional communities.

We seek candidates whose research, teaching, and service will
advance UC San Diego's transition to HSI and/or anti-racism,
anti-oppression, equity, and social justice with a focus on the
Latinx/Chicanx community. We especially welcome candidates whose
professional experience, community engagement, and personal
background have facilitated their understanding of and ability to
better serve students from traditionally underrepresented
communities in higher education. Faculty are expected to have an
inclusive approach to mentoring and advising that incorporates
working with women and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate
students.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensuring that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity present in our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of the University and the College of Engineering’s Strategic Plan, and this hiring initiative will make use of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan for the College of Engineering identifies priority areas for our investments and through the 2022-2023 academic year we are working to finalize a Diversity and Inclusive Excellence Plan. The College offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support professional development. Several programs exist to enhance the inclusiveness of our College, including a student-led Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.
 
Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a rapidly-growing College of Engineering that combines interdisciplinary research and scholarship with excellent instruction and service. The UGA College of Engineering currently enrolls over 4,000 engineering majors and has over 125 full-time faculty across 15 degree programs. The College of Engineering is comprised for four interdisciplinary schools: The School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical Engineering, The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The School of Chemical, Materials, and Biomedical Engineering, and The School of Computing — an innovative joint program shared with Franklin College of Arts and Sciences which launched this year.

Significant investments in infrastructure have resulted in an expansion of laboratory facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms and instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have space in two major capital projects on campus to create interdisciplinary research facilities. Our main instructional facility, Driftmier Engineering Center, has also undergone complete renovation to create flexible classrooms that enable a range of teaching modalities and the incorporation of interdisciplinary instructional labs. The common instructional facilities also foster diversity by allowing faculty, staff, and students to interact and collaborate in a single facility.

This position supports the major Resilient Infrastructure for Sustainability and Equity (RISE) hiring initiative. Aging infrastructure, urbanization, pollution and climate change are impacting communities and livelihoods with significant investments being made in infrastructure. Applicants in the area of Smart Infrastructure are encouraged to apply. Designing the next generation of infrastructure requires a deeper examination into the realities of today’s challenges (e.g. equity, access, and climate change) coupled with future, evolving and uncertain changes (e.g. electric mobility and Internet of Things). Traditional methods must evolve and leverage the multisource Big Data (traditional, new and emerging data sources); utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to understand the shifting mobility trends of people and goods; examine the inequities and impact in under-investing and access in transportation infrastructure; and address the vulnerability and risk associated with climate change. Research is needed to develop new, innovative, data-driven, and multifaceted decision-making solutions in transportation infrastructure with considerations of mobility, resiliency, safety, accessibility, equity, and sustainability within the broader context enriched by emerging technologies. Close collaboration with large multidisciplinary teams is expected to enable convergence research.
 
The RISE interdisciplinary cluster will unite and catalyze strengths in data science, engineering, environmental and atmospheric sciences, urban systems, public service and outreach, public administration, and law and policy to establish UGA as an international leader in smart and resilient infrastructure systems that protect people, their livelihoods, and their communities from severe weather impacts, climate change, man-made hazards, pollution, unsafe or degraded infrastructures, and other disruptions. The RISE cluster will produce fundamental research on next generation infrastructure and systems with emphasis on vulnerable communities connected with important assets including critical transportation infrastructure, military installations, ports and urban systems. Applications are sought in areas interfacing with data science and artificial intelligence that may include: Smart Interconnected Infrastructure Systems, Operations Research Using AI for Vulnerability and Risk Analysis of Critical Infrastructure Systems, AI Geotechnics, and AI-Empowered Intelligent Transportation Systems. The College of Engineering creates an ideal environment for candidates seeking opportunities to work in interdisciplinary collaborations across campus and address resilience issues in communities, especially those most at-risk, and infrastructure systems around the world.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensuring that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity present in our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core values of the University and the College of Engineering's Strategic Plan, and this hiring initiative will make use of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan for the College of Engineering identifies priority areas for our investments and through the 2022-2023 academic year we are working to finalize a Diversity and Inclusive Excellence Plan. The College offers structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support professional development. Several programs exist to enhance the inclusiveness of our College, including a student-led Engineering Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.
